not been done in a haphazard fashion or byguesswork but painstakingly and with the trustworthy guidance andsupport of personal familiarity with these several forms of speechI make this explanation for the reason that without it many readerswould suppose that all these characters were trying to talk alike andnot succeedingTHE AUTHORHUCKLEBERRY FINNScene  The Mississippi Valley Time  Forty to fifty years agoCHAPTER IYOU dont know about me without you have read a book by the name of TheAdventures of Tom Sawyer but that aint no matter  That book was madeby Mr Mark Twain and he told the truth mainly  There was thingswhich he stretched but mainly he told the truth  That is nothing  Inever seen anybody but lied one time or another without it was AuntPolly or the widow or maybe Mary  Aunt PollyToms Aunt Polly sheisand Mary and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book whichis mostly a true book with some stretchers as I said beforeNow the way that the book winds up is this  Tom and me found the moneythat the robbers hid in the cave and it made us rich  We got sixthousand dollars apieceall gold  It was an awful sight of money whenit was piled up  Well Judge Thatcher he took it and put it outat interest and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the yearroundmore than a body could tell what to do with  The Widow Douglasshe took me for her son and allowed she would sivilize me but it wasrough living in the house all the time considering how dismal regularand decent the widow was in all her ways and so when I couldnt standit no longer I lit out  I got into my old rags and my sugarhogsheadagain and was free and satisfied  But Tom Sawyer he hunted me up andsaid he was going to start a band of robbers and I might join if Iwould go back to the widow and be respectable  So I went backThe widow she cried over me and called me a poor lost lamb and shecalled me a lot of other names too but she never meant no harm byit She put me in them new clothes again and I couldnt do nothing butsweat and sweat and feel all cramped up  Well then the old thingcommenced again  The widow rung a bell for supper and you had to cometo time When you got to the table you couldnt go right to eating butyou had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a littleover the victuals though there warnt really anything the matter withthemthat is nothing only everything was cooked by itself  In abarrel of odds and ends it is different things get mixed up and thejuice kind of swaps around and the things go betterAfter supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and theBulrushers and I was in a sweat to find out all about him but by andby she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time sothen I didnt care no more about him because I dont take no stock indead peoplePretty soon I wanted to smoke and asked the widow to let me  But shewouldnt  She said it was a mean practice and wasnt clean and I musttry to not do it any more  That is just the way with some people  Theyget down on a thing when they dont know nothing about it  Here she wasabothering about Moses which was no kin to her and no use to anybodybeing gone you see yet finding a power of fault with me for doing athing that had some good in it  And she took snuff too of course thatwas all right because she done it herselfHer sister Miss Watson a tolerable slim old maid with goggles onhad just come to live with her and took a set at me now with aspellingbook She worked me middling hard for about an hour and thenthe widow made her ease up  I couldnt stood it much longer  Then foran hour it was deadly dull and I was fidgety  Miss Watson would sayDont put your feet up there Huckleberry and Dont scrunch uplike that Huckleberryset up straight and pretty soon she wouldsay Dont gap and stretch like that Huckleberrywhy dont you try tobehave  Then she told me all about the bad place and I said I wishedI was there She got mad then but I didnt mean no harm  All I wantedwas to go somewheres all I wanted was a change I warnt particular She said it was wicked to say what I said said she wouldnt say it forthe whole world she was going to live so as to go to the good place Well I couldnt see no advantage in going where she was going so Imade up my mind I wouldnt try for it  But I never said so because itwould only make trouble and wouldnt do no goodNow she had got a start and she went on and told me all about the goodplace  She said all a body would have to do there was to go around allday long with a harp and sing forever and ever  So I didnt thinkmuch of it But I never said so  I asked her if she reckoned Tom Sawyerwould go there and she said not by a considerable sight  I was gladabout that because I wanted him and me to be togetherMiss Watson she kept pecking at me and it got tiresome and lonesome By and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers and theneverybody was off to bed  I went up to my room with a piece of candleand put it on the table  Then I set down in a chair by the window andtried to think of something cheerful but it warnt no use  I feltso lonesome I most wished I was dead  The stars were shining and theleaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful and I heard an owl awayoff whowhooing about somebody that was dead and a whippowill and adog crying about somebody that was going to die and the wind was tryingto whisper something to me and I couldnt make out what it was and soit made the cold shivers run over me Then away out in the woods I heardthat kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell aboutsomething thats on its mind and cant make itself understood and socant rest easy in its grave and has to go about that way every nightgrieving  I got so downhearted and scared I did wish I had somecompany  Pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder and Iflipped it off and it lit in the candle and before I could budge itwas all shriveled up  I didnt need anybody to tell me that that wasan awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck so I was scaredand most shook the clothes off of me I got up and turned around in mytracks three times and crossed my breast every time and then I tiedup a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away  ButI hadnt no confidence  You do that when youve lost a horseshoe thatyouve found instead of nailing it up over the door but I hadnt everheard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when youd killeda spiderI set down again ashaking all over and got out my pipe for a smokefor the house was all as still as death now and so the widow wouldntknow Well after a long time I heard the clock away off in the towngo boomboomboomtwelve licks and all still againstiller thanever Pretty soon I heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst thetreessomething was a stirring  I set still and listened  Directly Icould just barely hear a meyow meyow down there  That was good Says I meyow meyow as soft as I could and then I put out thelight and scrambled out of the window on to the shed  Then I slippeddown to the ground and crawled in among the trees and sure enoughthere was Tom Sawyer waiting for meCHAPTER IIWE went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end ofthe widows garden stooping down so as the branches wouldnt scrape ourheads When we was passing by the kitchen I fell over a root and madea noise  We scrouched down and laid still  Miss Watsons big niggernamed Jim was setting in the kitchen door we could see him prettyclear because there was a light behind him  He got up and stretchedhis neck out about a minute listening  Then he saysWho dahHe listened some more then he come tiptoeing down and stood rightbetween us we could a touched him nearly  Well likely it wasminutes and minutes that there warnt a sound and we all there so closetogether  There was a place on my ankle that got to itching but Idasnt scratch it and then my ear begun to itch and next my backright between my shoulders  Seemed like Id die if I couldnt scratch Well Ive noticed that thing plenty times since  If you are withthe quality or at a funeral or trying to go to sleep when you aintsleepyif you are anywheres where it wont do for you to scratch whyyou will itch all over in upwards of a thousand places Pretty soon JimsaysSay who is you  Whar is you  Dog my cats ef I didn hear sumfnWell I know what Is gwyne to do  Is gwyne to set down here andlisten tell I hears it aginSo he set down on the ground betwixt me and Tom  He leaned his back upagainst a tree and stretched his legs out till one of them most touchedone of mine  My nose begun to itch  It itched till the tears come intomy eyes  But I dasnt scratch  Then it begun to itch on the insideNext I got to itching underneath  I didnt know how I was going to setstill This miserableness went on as much as six or seven minutes butit seemed a sight longer than that  I was itching in eleven differentplaces now  I reckoned I couldnt stand it moren a minute longerbut I set my teeth hard and got ready to try  Just then Jim begunto breathe heavy next he begun to snoreand then I was pretty sooncomfortable againTom he made a sign to mekind of a little noise with his mouthand wewent creeping away on our hands and knees  When we was ten foot off Tomwhispered to me and wanted to tie Jim to the tree for fun  But I saidno he might wake and make a disturbance and then theyd find out Iwarnt in Then Tom said he hadnt got candles enough and he would slipin the kitchen and get some more  I didnt want him to try  I said Jimmight wake up and come  But Tom wanted to resk it so we slid in thereand got three candles and Tom laid five cents on the table for payThen we got out and I was in a sweat to get away but nothing would doTom but he must crawl to where Jim was on his hands and knees and playsomething on him  I waited and it seemed a good while everything wasso still and lonesomeAs soon as Tom was back we cut along the path around the garden fenceand by and by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side ofthe house  Tom said he slipped Jims hat off of his head and hung iton a limb right over him and Jim stirred a little but he didnt wakeAfterwards Jim said the witches be witched him and put him in a tranceand rode him all over the State and then set him under the trees againand hung his hat on a limb to show who done it  And next time Jim toldit he said they rode him down to New Orleans and after that everytime he told it he spread it more and more till by and by he said theyrode him all over the world and tired him most to death and his backwas all over saddleboils  Jim was monstrous proud about it and hegot so he wouldnt hardly notice the other niggers  Niggers would comemiles to hear Jim tell about it and he was more looked up to than anynigger in that country  Strange niggers would stand with their mouthsopen and look him all over same as if he was a wonder  Niggers isalways talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire butwhenever one was talking and letting on to know all about such thingsJim would happen in and say Hm  What you know bout witches andthat nigger was corked up and had to take a back seat  Jim always keptthat fivecenter piece round his neck with a string and said it was acharm the devil give to him with his own hands and told him he couldcure anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he wanted to just bysaying something to it but he never told what it was he said to it Niggers would come from all around there and give Jim anything theyhad just for a sight of that fivecenter piece but they wouldnt touchit because the devil had had his hands on it  Jim was most ruined fora servant because he got stuck up on account of having seen the deviland been rode by witchesWell when Tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away downinto the village and could see three or four lights twinkling wherethere was sick folks maybe and the stars over us was sparkling everso fine and down by the village was the river a whole mile broad andawful still and grand  We went down the hill and found Jo Harper andBen Rogers and two or three more of the boys hid in the old tanyard So we unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a halfto the big scar on the hillside and went ashoreWe went to a clump of bushes and Tom made everybody swear to keep thesecret and then showed them a hole in the hill right in the thickestpart of the bushes  Then we lit the candles and crawled in on ourhands and knees  We went about two hundred yards and then the caveopened up Tom poked about amongst the passages and pretty soon duckedunder a wall where you wouldnt a noticed that there was a hole  Wewent along a narrow place and got into a kind of room all damp andsweaty and cold and there we stopped  Tom saysNow well start this band of robbers and call it Tom Sawyers GangEverybody that wants to join has got to take an oath and write his namein bloodEverybody was willing  So Tom got out a sheet of paper that he hadwrote the oath on and read it  It swore every boy to stick to theband and never tell any of the secrets and if anybody done anything toany boy in the band whichever boy was ordered to kill that person andhis family must do it and he mustnt eat and he mustnt sleep till hehad killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts which was the signof the band And nobody that didnt belong to the band could use thatmark and if he did he must be sued and if he done it again he must bekilled  And if anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets hemust have his throat cut and then have his carcass burnt up and theashes scattered all around and his name blotted off of the list withblood and never mentioned again by the gang but have a curse put on itand be forgot foreverEverybody said it was a real beautiful oath and asked Tom if he gotit out of his own head  He said some of it but the rest was out ofpiratebooks and robberbooks and every gang that was hightoned haditSome thought it would be good to kill the families of boys that toldthe secrets  Tom said it was a good idea so he took a pencil and wroteit in Then Ben Rogers saysHeres Huck Finn he haint got no family what you going to do bouthimWell haint he got a father says Tom SawyerYes hes got a father but you cant never find him these days  Heused to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard but he haint been seenin these parts for a year or moreThey talked it over and they was going to rule me out because theysaid every boy must have a family or somebody to kill or else itwouldnt be fair and square for the others  Well nobody could think ofanything to doeverybody was stumped and set still  I was most readyto cry but all at once I thought of a way and so I offered them MissWatsonthey could kill her  Everybody saidOh shell do  Thats all right  Huck can come inThen they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign withand I made my mark on the paperNow says Ben Rogers whats the line of business of this GangNothing only robbery and murder Tom saidBut who are we going to robhouses or cattle orStuff stealing cattle and such things aint robbery its burglarysays Tom Sawyer  We aint burglars  That aint no sort of style  Weare highwaymen  We stop stages and carriages on the road with maskson and kill the people and take their watches and moneyMust we always kill the peopleOh certainly  Its best  Some authorities think different butmostly its considered best to kill themexcept some that you bring tothe cave here and keep them till theyre ransomedRansomed  Whats thatI dont know  But thats what they do  Ive seen it in books and soof course thats what weve got to doBut how can we do it if we dont know what it isWhy blame it all weve got to do it  Dont I tell you its in thebooks  Do you want to go to doing different from whats in the booksand get things all muddled upOh thats all very fine to say Tom Sawyer but how in the nationare these fellows going to be ransomed if we dont know how to do itto themthats the thing I want to get at  Now what do you reckon itisWell I dont know  But peraps if we keep them till theyre ransomedit means that we keep them till theyre deadNow thats something like  Thatll answer  Why couldnt you saidthat before  Well keep them till theyre ransomed to death and abothersome lot theyll be tooeating up everything and always tryingto get looseHow you talk Ben Rogers  How can they get loose when theres a guardover them ready to shoot them down if they move a pegA guard  Well that is good  So somebodys got to set up all nightand never get any sleep just so as to watch them  I think thatsfoolishness Why cant a body take a club and ransom them as soon asthey get hereBecause it aint in the books sothats why  Now Ben Rogers do youwant to do things regular or dont youthats the idea  Dont youreckon that the people that made the books knows whats the correctthing to do  Do you reckon you can learn em anything  Not by a gooddeal No sir well just go on and ransom them in the regular wayAll right  I dont mind but I say its a fool way anyhow  Say dowe kill the women tooWell Ben Rogers if I was as ignorant as you I wouldnt let on  Killthe women  No nobody ever saw anything in the books like that  Youfetch them to the cave and youre always as polite as pie to themand by and by they fall in love with you and never want to go home anymoreWell if thats the way Im agreed but I dont take no stock in itMighty soon well have the cave so cluttered up with women and fellowswaiting to be ransomed that there wont be no place for the robbersBut go ahead I aint got nothing to sayLittle Tommy Barnes was asleep now and when they waked him up he wasscared and cried and said he wanted to go home to his ma and didntwant to be a robber any moreSo they all made fun of him and called him crybaby and that made himmad and he said he would go straight and tell all the secrets  ButTom give him five cents to keep quiet and said we would all go home andmeet next week and rob somebody and kill some peopleBen Rogers said he couldnt get out much only Sundays and so he wantedto begin next Sunday but all the boys said it would be wicked to do iton Sunday and that settled the thing  They agreed to get together andfix a day as soon as they could and then we elected Tom Sawyer firstcaptain and Jo Harper second captain of the Gang and so started homeI clumb up the shed and crept into my window just before day wasbreaking My new clothes was all greased up and clayey and I wasdogtiredCHAPTER IIIWELL I got a good goingover in the morning from old Miss Watson onaccount of my clothes but the widow she didnt scold but only cleanedoff the grease and clay and looked so sorry that I thought I wouldbehave awhile if I could  Then Miss Watson she took me in the closetand prayed but nothing come of it  She told me to pray every day andwhatever I asked for I would get it  But it warnt so  I tried itOnce I got a fishline but no hooks  It warnt any good to me withouthooks  I tried for the hooks three or four times but somehow Icouldnt make it work  By and by one day I asked Miss Watson totry for me but she said I was a fool  She never told me why and Icouldnt make it out no wayI set down one time back in the woods and had a long think about it I says to myself if a body can get anything they pray for why dontDeacon Winn get back the money he lost on pork  Why cant the widow getback her silver snuffbox that was stole  Why cant Miss Watson fat upNo says I to my self there aint nothing in it  I went and told thewidow about it and she said the thing a body could get by praying forit was spiritual gifts  This was too many for me but she told mewhat she meantI must help other people and do everything I could forother people and look out for them all the time and never think aboutmyself This was including Miss Watson as I took it  I went out in thewoods and turned it over in my mind a long time but I couldnt see noadvantage about itexcept for the other people so at last I reckonedI wouldnt worry about it any more but just let it go  Sometimes thewidow would take me one side and talk about Providence in a way to makea bodys mouth water but maybe next day Miss Watson would take holdand knock it all down again  I judged I could see that there was twoProvidences and a poor chap would stand considerable show with thewidows Providence but if Miss Watsons got him there warnt no helpfor him any more  I thought it all out and reckoned I would belongto the widows if he wanted me though I couldnt make out how he wasagoing to be any better off then than what he was before seeing I wasso ignorant and so kind of lowdown and orneryPap he hadnt been seen for more than a year and that was comfortablefor me I didnt want to see him no more  He used to always whale mewhen he was sober and could get his hands on me though I used to taketo the woods most of the time when he was around  Well about this timehe was found in the river drownded about twelve mile above town sopeople said  They judged it was him anyway said this drownded man wasjust his size and was ragged and had uncommon long hair which was alllike pap but they couldnt make nothing out of the face because it hadbeen in the water so long it warnt much like a face at all  They saidhe was floating on his back in the water  They took him and buried himon the bank  But I warnt comfortable long because I happened to thinkof something  I knowed mighty well that a drownded man dont float onhis back but on his face  So I knowed then that this warnt pap buta woman dressed up in a mans clothes  So I was uncomfortable again I judged the old man would turn up again by and by though I wished hewouldntWe played robber now and then about a month and then I resigned  Allthe boys did  We hadnt robbed nobody hadnt killed any people butonly just pretended  We used to hop out of the woods and go chargingdown on hogdrivers and women in carts taking garden stuff to marketbut we never hived any of them  Tom Sawyer called the hogs ingotsand he called the turnips and stuff julery and we would go to thecave and powwow over what we had done and how many people we had killedand marked  But I couldnt see no profit in it  One time Tom sent aboy to run about town with a blazing stick which he called a sloganwhich was the sign for the Gang to get together and then he said hehad got secret news by his spies that next day a whole parcel of Spanishmerchants and rich Arabs was going to camp in Cave Hollow with twohundred elephants and six hundred camels and over a thousand sumtermules all loaded down with dimonds and they didnt have only a guardof four hundred soldiers and so we would lay in ambuscade as he calledit and kill the lot and scoop the things  He said we must slick upour swords and guns and get ready  He never could go after even aturnipcart but he must have the swords and guns all scoured up for itthough they was only lath and broomsticks and you might scour at themtill you rotted and then they warnt worth a mouthful of ashes morethan what they was before  I didnt believe we could lick such a crowdof Spaniards and Arabs but I wanted to see the camels and elephantsso I was on hand next day Saturday in the ambuscade and when we gotthe word we rushed out of the woods and down the hill  But there warntno Spaniards and Arabs and there warnt no camels nor no elephants It warnt anything but a Sundayschool picnic and only a primerclassat that  We busted it up and chased the children up the hollow but wenever got anything but some doughnuts and jam though Ben Rogers gota rag doll and Jo Harper got a hymnbook and a tract and then theteacher charged in and made us drop everything and cut I didnt see no dimonds and I told Tom Sawyer so  He said there wasloads of them there anyway and he said there was Arabs there tooand elephants and things  I said why couldnt we see them then  Hesaid if I warnt so ignorant but had read a book called Don Quixote Iwould know without asking  He said it was all done by enchantment  Hesaid there was hundreds of soldiers there and elephants and treasureand so on but we had enemies which he called magicians and they hadturned the whole thing into an infant Sundayschool just out of spite I said all right then the thing for us to do was to go for themagicians  Tom Sawyer said I was a numskullWhy said he a magician could call up a lot of genies and theywould hash you up like nothing before you could say Jack Robinson  Theyare as tall as a tree and as big around as a churchWell I says spose we got some genies to help uscant we lickthe other crowd thenHow you going to get themI dont know  How do they get themWhy they rub an old tin lamp or an iron ring and then the geniescome tearing in with the thunder and lightning aripping around and thesmoke arolling and everything theyre told to do they up and do it They dont think nothing of pulling a shottower up by the roots andbelting a Sundayschool superintendent over the head with itor anyother manWho makes them tear around soWhy whoever rubs the lamp or the ring  They belong to whoever rubsthe lamp or the ring and theyve got to do whatever he says  If hetells them to build a palace forty miles long out of dimonds and fillit full of chewinggum or whatever you want and fetch an emperorsdaughter from China for you to marry theyve got to do itand theyvegot to do it before sunup next morning too  And more  theyve gotto waltz that palace around over the country wherever you want it youunderstandWell says I I think they are a pack of flatheads for not keepingthe palace themselves stead of fooling them away like that  And whatsmoreif I was one of them I would see a man in Jericho before I woulddrop my business and come to him for the rubbing of an old tin lampHow you talk Huck Finn  Why youd have to come when he rubbed itwhether you wanted to or notWhat and I as high as a tree and as big as a church  All right thenI would come but I lay Id make that man climb the highest tree therewas in the countryShucks it aint no use to talk to you Huck Finn  You dont seem toknow anything somehowperfect sapheadI thought all this over for two or three days and then I reckoned Iwould see if there was anything in it  I got an old tin lamp and aniron ring and went out in the woods and rubbed and rubbed till I sweatlike an Injun calculating to build a palace and sell it but it warntno use none of the genies come  So then I judged that all that stuffwas only just one of Tom Sawyers lies  I reckoned he believed in theArabs and the elephants but as for me I think different  It had allthe marks of a SundayschoolCHAPTER IVWELL three or four months run along and it was well into the winternow I had been to school most all the time and could spell and read andwrite just a little and could say the multiplication table up to sixtimes seven is thirtyfive and I dont reckon I could ever get anyfurther than that if I was to live forever  I dont take no stock inmathematics anywayAt first I hated the school but by and by I got so I could stand itWhenever I got uncommon tired I played hookey and the hiding I got nextday done me good and cheered me up  So the longer I went to school theeasier it got to be  I was getting sort of used to the widows waystoo and they warnt so raspy on me  Living in a house and sleeping ina bed pulled on me pretty tight mostly but before the cold weather Iused to slide out and sleep in the woods sometimes and so that was arest to me  I liked the old ways best but I was getting so I liked thenew ones too a little bit The widow said I was coming along slow butsure and doing very satisfactory  She said she warnt ashamed of meOne morning I happened to turn over the saltcellar at breakfast I reached for some of it as quick as I could to throw over my leftshoulder and keep off the bad luck but Miss Watson was in ahead of meand crossed me off She says Take your hands away Huckleberry whata mess you are always making  The widow put in a good word for me butthat warnt going to keep off the bad luck I knowed that well enough I started out after breakfast feeling worried and shaky andwondering where it was going to fall on me and what it was going to be There is ways to keep off some kinds of bad luck but this wasnt oneof them kind so I never tried to do anything but just poked alonglowspirited and on the watchoutI went down to the front garden and clumb over the stile where you gothrough the high board fence  There was an inch of new snow on theground and I seen somebodys tracks  They had come up from the quarryand stood around the stile a while and then went on around the gardenfence  It was funny they hadnt come in after standing around so  Icouldnt make it out  It was very curious somehow  I was going tofollow around but I stooped down to look at the tracks first  I didntnotice anything at first but next I did  There was a cross in the leftbootheel made with big nails to keep off the devilI was up in a second and shinning down the hill  I looked over myshoulder every now and then but I didnt see nobody  I was at JudgeThatchers as quick as I could get there  He saidWhy my boy you are all out of breath  Did you come for yourinterestNo sir I says is there some for meOh yes a halfyearly is in last nightover a hundred and fiftydollars  Quite a fortune for you  You had better let me invest italong with your six thousand because if you take it youll spend itNo sir I says I dont want to spend it  I dont want it atallnor the six thousand nuther  I want you to take it I want to giveit to youthe six thousand and allHe looked surprised  He couldnt seem to make it out  He saysWhy what can you mean my boyI says Dont you ask me no questions about it please  Youll takeitwont youHe saysWell Im puzzled  Is something the matterPlease take it says I and dont ask me nothingthen I wont have totell no liesHe studied a while and then he saysOhoo  I think I see  You want to sell all your property to menotgive it  Thats the correct ideaThen he wrote something on a paper and read it over and saysThere you see it says for a consideration  That means I have boughtit of you and paid you for it  Heres a dollar for you  Now you signitSo I signed it and leftMiss Watsons nigger Jim had a hairball as big as your fist whichhad been took out of the fourth stomach of an ox and he used to domagic with it  He said there was a spirit inside of it and it knowedeverything  So I went to him that night and told him pap was hereagain for I found his tracks in the snow  What I wanted to know waswhat he was going to do and was he going to stay  Jim got out hishairball and said something over it and then he held it up and droppedit on the floor  It fell pretty solid and only rolled about an inch Jim tried it again and then another time and it acted just the same Jim got down on his knees and put his ear against it and listened But it warnt no use he said it wouldnt talk He said sometimes itwouldnt talk without money  I told him I had an old slick counterfeitquarter that warnt no good because the brass showed through the silvera little and it wouldnt pass nohow even if the brass didnt showbecause it was so slick it felt greasy and so that would tell on itevery time  I reckoned I wouldnt say nothing about the dollar I gotfrom the judge I said it was pretty bad money but maybe the hairballwould take it because maybe it wouldnt know the difference  Jim smeltit and bit it and rubbed it and said he would manage so the hairballwould think it was good  He said he would split open a raw Irish potatoand stick the quarter in between and keep it there all night and nextmorning you couldnt see no brass and it wouldnt feel greasy no moreand so anybody in town would take it in a minute let alone a hairball Well I knowed a potato would do that before but I had forgot itJim put the quarter under the hairball and got down and listenedagain This time he said the hairball was all right  He said itwould tell my whole fortune if I wanted it to  I says go on  So thehairball talked to Jim and Jim told it to me  He saysYo ole father doan know yit what hes agwyne to do  Sometimes hespec hell go way en den agin he spec hell stay  De bes way

and went up to my room that night there sat pap hisown selfCHAPTER VI had shut the door to  Then I turned around and there he was  I usedto be scared of him all the time he tanned me so much  I reckoned Iwas scared now too but in a minute I see I was mistakenthat is afterthe first jolt as you may say when my breath sort of hitched he beingso unexpected but right away after I see I warnt scared of him worthbothring aboutHe was most fifty and he looked it  His hair was long and tangled andgreasy and hung down and you could see his eyes shining throughlike he was behind vines  It was

how much you got in your pocket  I want itI haint got only a dollar and I want that toIt dont make no difference what you want it foryou just shell itoutHe took it and bit it to see if it was good and then he said he wasgoing down town to get some whisky said he hadnt had a drink all dayWhen he had got out on the shed he put his head in again and cussedme for putting on frills and trying to be better than him and when Ireckoned he was gone he come back and put his head in again and told meto mind about that school because he was going to lay for me and lickme if I didnt drop thatNext day he was drunk and he went to Judge Thatchers and bullyraggedhim and tried to make him give up the money but he couldnt and thenhe swore hed make the law force himThe judge and the widow went to law to get the court to take me awayfrom him and let one of them be my guardian but it was a new judge thathad just come and he didnt know the old man so he said courts mustntinterfere and separate families if they could help it said hed druthernot take a child away from its father  So Judge Thatcher and the widowhad to quit on the businessThat pleased the old man till he couldnt rest  He said hed cowhideme till I was black and blue if I didnt raise some money for him  Iborrowed three dollars from Judge Thatcher and pap took it and gotdrunk and went ablowing around and cussing and whooping and carryingon and he kept it up all over town with a tin pan till most midnightthen they jailed him and next day they had him before court and jailedhim again for a week  But he said he was satisfied said he was bossof his son and hed make it warm for himWhen he got out the new judge said he was agoing to make a man of himSo he took him to his own house and dressed him up clean and nice andhad him to breakfast and dinner and supper with the family and was justold pie to him so to speak  And after supper he talked to him abouttemperance and such things till the old man cried and said hed beena fool and fooled away his life but now he was agoing to turn overa new leaf and be a man nobody wouldnt be ashamed of and he hoped thejudge would help him and not look down on him  The judge said he couldhug him for them words so he cried and his wife she cried again papsaid hed been a man that had always been misunderstood before and thejudge said he believed it  The old man said that what a man wantedthat was down was sympathy and the judge said it was so so they criedagain  And when it was bedtime the old man rose up and held out hishand and saysLook at it gentlemen and ladies all take ahold of it shake itTheres a hand that was the hand of a hog but it aint so no more itsthe hand of a man thats started in on a new life andll die beforehell go back  You mark them wordsdont forget I said them  Its aclean hand now shake itdont be afeardSo they shook it one after the other all around and cried  Thejudges wife she kissed it  Then the old man he signed a pledgemadehis mark The judge said it was the holiest time on record or somethinglike that Then they tucked the old man into a beautiful room which wasthe spare room and in the night some time he got powerful thirsty andclumb out on to the porchroof and slid down a stanchion and traded hisnew coat for a jug of fortyrod and clumb back again and had a good oldtime and towards daylight he crawled out again drunk as a fiddler androlled off the porch and broke his left arm in two places and was mostfroze to death when somebody found him after sunup  And when they cometo look at that spare room they had to take soundings before they couldnavigate itThe judge he felt kind of sore  He said he reckoned a body could reformthe old man with a shotgun maybe but he didnt know no other wayCHAPTER VIWELL pretty soon the old man was up and around again and then he wentfor Judge Thatcher in the courts to make him give up that money and hewent for me too for not stopping school  He catched me a couple oftimes and thrashed me but I went to school just the same and dodgedhim or outrun him most of the time  I didnt want to go to school muchbefore but I reckoned Id go now to spite pap  That law trial was aslow businessappeared like they warnt ever going to get started on itso every now and then Id borrow two or three dollars off of the judgefor him to keep from getting a cowhiding  Every time he got money hegot drunk and every time he got drunk he raised Cain around town andevery time he raised Cain he got jailed  He was just suitedthis kindof thing was right in his lineHe got to hanging around the widows too much and so she told him atlast that if he didnt quit using around there she would make troublefor him Well wasnt he mad  He said he would show who was HuckFinns boss  So he watched out for me one day in the spring andcatched me and took me up the river about three mile in a skiff andcrossed over to the Illinois shore where it was woody and there warntno houses but an old log hut in a place where the timber was so thickyou couldnt find it if you didnt know where it wasHe kept me with him all the time and I never got a chance to run offWe lived in that old cabin and he always locked the door and put thekey under his head nights  He had a gun which he had stole I reckonand we fished and hunted and that was what we lived on  Every littlewhile he locked me in and went down to the store three miles to theferry and traded fish and game for whisky and fetched it home and gotdrunk and had a good time and licked me  The widow she found out whereI was by and by and she sent a man over to try to get hold of me butpap drove him off with the gun and it warnt long after that till I wasused to being where I was and liked itall but the cowhide partIt was kind of lazy and jolly laying off comfortable all day smokingand fishing and no books nor study  Two months or more run along andmy clothes got to be all rags and dirt and I didnt see how Id evergot to like it so well at the widows where you had to wash and eat ona plate and comb up and go to bed and get up regular and be foreverbothering over a book and have old Miss Watson pecking at you all thetime  I didnt want to go back no more  I had stopped cussing becausethe widow didnt like it but now I took to it again because pap hadntno objections  It was pretty good times up in the woods there take itall aroundBut by and by pap got too handy with his hickry and I couldnt standit I was all over welts  He got to going away so much too andlocking me in  Once he locked me in and was gone three days  It wasdreadful lonesome  I judged he had got drownded and I wasnt evergoing to get out any more  I was scared  I made up my mind I would fixup some way to leave there  I had tried to get out of that cabin manya time but I couldnt find no way  There warnt a window to it bigenough for a dog to get through  I couldnt get up the chimbly itwas too narrow  The door was thick solid oak slabs  Pap was prettycareful not to leave a knife or anything in the cabin when he was awayI reckon I had hunted the place over as much as a hundred times well Iwas most all the time at it because it was about the only way to put inthe time  But this time I found something at last I found an old rustywoodsaw without any handle it was laid in between a rafter and theclapboards of the roof I greased it up and went to work  There was anold horseblanket nailed against the logs at the far end of the cabinbehind the table to keep the wind from blowing through the chinks andputting the candle out  I got under the table and raised the blanketand went to work to saw a section of the big bottom log outbig enoughto let me through  Well it was a good long job but I was gettingtowards the end of it when I heard paps gun in the woods  I got rid ofthe signs of my work and dropped the blanket and hid my saw and prettysoon pap come inPap warnt in a good humorso he was his natural self  He said he wasdown town and everything was going wrong  His lawyer said he reckonedhe would win his lawsuit and get the money if they ever got started onthe trial but then there was ways to put it off a long time and JudgeThatcher knowed how to do it And he said people allowed thered beanother trial to get me away from him and give me to the widow for myguardian and they guessed it would win this time  This shook me upconsiderable because I didnt want to go back to the widows any moreand be so cramped up and sivilized as they called it  Then the old mangot to cussing and cussed everything and everybody he could think ofand then cussed them all over again to make sure he hadnt skipped anyand after that he polished off with a kind of a general cuss all roundincluding a considerable parcel of people which he didnt know the namesof and so called them whatshisname when he got to them and wentright along with his cussingHe said he would like to see the widow get me  He said he would watchout and if they tried to come any such game on him he knowed of a placesix or seven mile off to stow me in where they might hunt till theydropped and they couldnt find me  That made me pretty uneasy againbut only for a minute I reckoned I wouldnt stay on hand till he gotthat chanceThe old man made me go to the skiff and fetch the things he hadgot There was a fiftypound sack of corn meal and a side of baconammunition and a fourgallon jug of whisky and an old book and twonewspapers for wadding besides some tow  I toted up a load and wentback and set down on the bow of the skiff to rest  I thought it allover and I reckoned I would walk off with the gun and some lines andtake to the woods when I run away  I guessed I wouldnt stay in oneplace but just tramp right across the country mostly night times andhunt and fish to keep alive and so get so far away that the old man northe widow couldnt ever find me any more  I judged I would saw out andleave that night if pap got drunk enough and I reckoned he would  Igot so full of it I didnt notice how long I was staying till the oldman hollered and asked me whether I was asleep or drowndedI got the things all up to the cabin and then it was about dark  WhileI was cooking supper the old man took a swig or two and got sort ofwarmed up and went to ripping again  He had been drunk over in townand laid in the gutter all night and he was a sight to look at  A bodywould a thought he was Adamhe was just all mud  Whenever his liquorbegun to work he most always went for the govment this time he saysCall this a govment why just look at it and see what its likeHeres the law astanding ready to take a mans son away from himamans own son which he has had all the trouble and all the anxietyand all the expense of raising  Yes just as that man has got thatson raised at last and ready to go to work and begin to do suthin forhim and give him a rest the law up and goes for him  And they callthat govment  That aint all nuther  The law backs that old JudgeThatcher up and helps him to keep me out o my property  Heres whatthe law does  The law takes a man worth six thousand dollars andupards and jams him into an old trap of a cabin like this and letshim go round in clothes that aint fitten for a hog They call thatgovment  A man cant get his rights in a govment like this SometimesIve a mighty notion to just leave the country for good and all Yesand I told em so I told old Thatcher so to his face  Lots of emheard me and can tell what I said  Says I for two cents Id leave theblamed country and never come anear it agin  Thems the very words  Isays look at my hatif you call it a hatbut the lid raises up and therest of it goes down till its below my chin and then it aint rightlya hat at all but more like my head was shoved up through a jint ostovepipe  Look at it says Isuch a hat for me to wearone of thewealthiest men in this town if I could git my rightsOh yes this is a wonderful govment wonderful  Why looky hereThere was a free nigger there from Ohioa mulatter most as white asa white man  He had the whitest shirt on you ever see too and theshiniest hat and there aint a man in that town thats got as fineclothes as what he had and he had a gold watch and chain and asilverheaded canethe awfulest old grayheaded nabob in the State  Andwhat do you think  They said he was a pfessor in a college and couldtalk all kinds of languages and knowed everything  And that aint thewust They said he could vote when he was at home  Well that let meout Thinks I what is the country acoming to  It was lection dayand I was just about to go and vote myself if I warnt too drunk to getthere but when they told me there was a State in this country wheretheyd let that nigger vote I drawed out  I says Ill never vote agin Thems the very words I said they all heard me and the country mayrot for all meIll never vote agin as long as I live  And to see thecool way of that niggerwhy he wouldnt a give me the road if I hadntshoved him out o the way  I says to the people why aint this niggerput up at auction and soldthats what I want to know  And what do youreckon they said Why they said he couldnt be sold till hed been inthe State six months and he hadnt been there that long yet  Therenowthats a specimen  They call that a govment that cant sell a freenigger till hes been in the State six months  Heres a govment thatcalls itself a govment and lets on to be a govment and thinks it is agovment and yets got to set stockstill for six whole months beforeit can take a hold of a prowling thieving infernal whiteshirted freenigger andPap was agoing on so he never noticed where his old limber legs wastaking him to so he went head over heels over the tub of salt pork andbarked both shins and the rest of his speech was all the hottest kindof languagemostly hove at the nigger and the govment though he givethe tub some too all along here and there  He hopped around thecabin considerable first on one leg and then on the other holdingfirst one shin and then the other one and at last he let out with hisleft foot all of a sudden and fetched the tub a rattling kick  But itwarnt good judgment because that was the boot that had a couple of histoes leaking out of the front end of it so now he raised a howl thatfairly made a bodys hair raise and down he went in the dirt androlled there and held his toes and the cussing he done then laid overanything he had ever done previous  He said so his own self afterwards He had heard old Sowberry Hagan in his best days and he said it laidover him too but I reckon that was sort of piling it on maybeAfter supper pap took the jug and said he had enough whisky therefor two drunks and one delirium tremens  That was always his word  Ijudged he would be blind drunk in about an hour and then I would stealthe key or saw myself out one or tother  He drank and drank andtumbled down on his blankets by and by but luck didnt run my way He didnt go sound asleep but was uneasy  He groaned and moaned andthrashed around this way and that for a long time  At last I got sosleepy I couldnt keep my eyes open all I could do and so before Iknowed what I was about I was sound asleep and the candle burningI dont know how long I was asleep but all of a sudden there was anawful scream and I was up  There was pap looking wild and skippingaround every which way and yelling about snakes  He said they wascrawling up his legs and then he would give a jump and scream and sayone had bit him on the cheekbut I couldnt see no snakes  He startedand run round and round the cabin hollering Take him off take himoff hes biting me on the neck  I never see a man look so wild in theeyes Pretty soon he was all fagged out and fell down panting then herolled over and over wonderful fast kicking things every which wayand striking and grabbing at the air with his hands and screaming andsaying there was devils ahold of him  He wore out by and by and laidstill a while moaning  Then he laid stiller and didnt make a sound I could hear the owls and the wolves away off in the woods and itseemed terrible still  He was laying over by the corner By and by heraised up part way and listened with his head to one side  He saysvery lowTramptramptramp thats the dead tramptramptramp theyre comingafter me but I wont go  Oh theyre here dont touch medont handsofftheyre cold let go  Oh let a poor devil aloneThen he went down on all fours and crawled off begging them to let himalone and he rolled himself up in his blanket and wallowed in under theold pine table still abegging and then he went to crying  I couldhear him through the blanketBy and by he rolled out and jumped up on his feet looking wild and hesee me and went for me  He chased me round and round the place with aclaspknife calling me the Angel of Death and saying he would kill meand then I couldnt come for him no more  I begged and told him Iwas only Huck but he laughed such a screechy laugh and roared andcussed and kept on chasing me up  Once when I turned short anddodged under his arm he made a grab and got me by the jacket between myshoulders and I thought I was gone but I slid out of the jacket quickas lightning and saved myself Pretty soon he was all tired out anddropped down with his back against the door and said he would rest aminute and then kill me He put his knife under him and said he wouldsleep and get strong and then he would see who was whoSo he dozed off pretty soon  By and by I got the old splitbottom chairand clumb up as easy as I could not to make any noise and got down thegun  I slipped the ramrod down it to make sure it was loaded then Ilaid it across the turnip barrel pointing towards pap and set downbehind it to wait for him to stir  And how slow and still the time diddrag alongCHAPTER VIIGIT up  What you boutI opened my eyes and looked around trying to make out where I was  Itwas after sunup and I had been sound asleep  Pap was standing over melooking sour and sick too  He saysWhat you doin with this gunI judged he didnt know nothing about what he had been doing so I saysSomebody tried to get in so I was laying for himWhy didnt you roust me outWell I tried to but I couldnt I couldnt budge youWell all right  Dont stand there palavering all day but out withyou and see if theres a fish on the lines for breakfast  Ill be alongin a minuteHe unlocked the door and I cleared out up the riverbank  I noticedsome pieces of limbs and such things floating down and a sprinkling ofbark so I knowed the river had begun to rise  I reckoned I would havegreat times now if I was over at the town  The June rise used to bealways luck for me because as soon as that rise begins here comescordwood floating down and pieces of log raftssometimes a dozen logstogether so all you have to do is to catch them and sell them to thewoodyards and the sawmillI went along up the bank with one eye out for pap and tother one outfor what the rise might fetch along  Well all at once here comes acanoe just a beauty too about thirteen or fourteen foot long ridinghigh like a duck  I shot headfirst off of the bank like a frogclothes and all on and struck out for the canoe  I just expectedthered be somebody laying down in it because people often done thatto fool folks and when a chap had pulled a skiff out most to it theydraise up and laugh at him  But it warnt so this time  It was adriftcanoe sure enough and I clumb in and paddled her ashore  ThinksI the old man will be glad when he sees thisshes worth ten dollars But when I got to shore pap wasnt in sight yet and as I was runningher into a little creek like a gully all hung over with vines andwillows I struck another idea  I judged Id hide her good and thenstead of taking to the woods when I run off Id go down the riverabout fifty mile and camp in one place for good and not have such arough time tramping on footIt was pretty close to the shanty and I thought I heard the old mancoming all the time but I got her hid and then I out and looked arounda bunch of willows and there was the old man down the path a piece justdrawing a bead on a bird with his gun  So he hadnt seen anythingWhen he got along I was hard at it taking up a trot line  He abusedme a little for being so slow but I told him I fell in the river andthat was what made me so long  I knowed he would see I was wet andthen he would be asking questions  We got five catfish off the linesand went homeWhile we laid off after breakfast to sleep up both of us being aboutwore out I got to thinking that if I could fix up some way to keep papand the widow from trying to follow me it would be a certainer thingthan trusting to luck to get far enough off before they missed me yousee all kinds of things might happen  Well I didnt see no way for awhile but by and by pap raised up a minute to drink another barrel ofwater and he saysAnother time a man comes aprowling round here you roust me out youhear That man warnt here for no good  Id a shot him  Next time youroust me out you hearThen he dropped down and went to sleep again but what he had beensaying give me the very idea I wanted  I says to myself I can fix itnow so nobody wont think of following meAbout twelve oclock we turned out and went along up the bank  Theriver was coming up pretty fast and lots of driftwood going by on therise By and by along comes part of a log raftnine logs fast together We went out with the skiff and towed it ashore  Then we had dinnerAnybody but pap would a waited and seen the day through so as to catchmore stuff but that warnt paps style  Nine logs was enough for onetime he must shove right over to town and sell  So he locked me in andtook the skiff and started off towing the raft about halfpast three I judged he wouldnt come back that night  I waited till I reckoned hehad got a good start then I out with my saw and went to work on thatlog again  Before he was tother side of the river I was out of thehole him and his raft was just a speck on the water away off yonderI took the sack of corn meal and took it to where the canoe was hid andshoved the vines and branches apart and put it in then I done the samewith the side of bacon then the whiskyjug  I took all the coffee andsugar there was and all the ammunition I took the wadding I took thebucket and gourd I took a dipper and a tin cup and my old saw and twoblankets and the skillet and the coffeepot  I took fishlines andmatches and other thingseverything that was worth a cent  I cleanedout the place  I wanted an axe but there wasnt any only the one outat the woodpile and I knowed why I was going to leave that  I fetchedout the gun and now I was doneI had wore the ground a good deal crawling out of the hole and draggingout so many things  So I fixed that as good as I could from the outsideby scattering dust on the place which covered up the smoothness and thesawdust  Then I fixed the piece of log back into its place and put tworocks under it and one against it to hold it there for it was bent upat that place and didnt quite touch ground  If you stood four or fivefoot away and didnt know it was sawed you wouldnt never noticeit and besides this was the back of the cabin and it warnt likelyanybody would go fooling around thereIt was all grass clear to the canoe so I hadnt left a track  Ifollowed around to see  I stood on the bank and looked out over theriver  All safe  So I took the gun and went up a piece into the woodsand was hunting around for some birds when I see a wild pig hogs soonwent wild in them bottoms after they had got away from the prairiefarms I shot this fellow and took him into campI took the axe and smashed in the door  I beat it and hacked itconsiderable adoing it  I fetched the pig in and took him back nearlyto the table and hacked into his throat with the axe and laid him downon the ground to bleed I say ground because it was groundhard packedand no boards  Well next I took an old sack and put a lot of big rocksin itall I could dragand I started it from the pig and dragged it tothe door and through the woods down to the river and dumped it in anddown it sunk out of sight  You could easy see that something had beendragged over the ground  I did wish Tom Sawyer was there I knowed hewould take an interest in this kind of business and throw in the fancytouches  Nobody could spread himself like Tom Sawyer in such a thing asthatWell last I pulled out some of my hair and blooded the axe good andstuck it on the back side and slung the axe in the corner  Then Itook up the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket so he couldntdrip till I got a good piece below the house and then dumped him intothe river  Now I thought of something else  So I went and got the bagof meal and my old saw out of the canoe and fetched them to the house I took the bag to where it used to stand and ripped a hole in thebottom of it with the saw for there warnt no knives and forks on theplacepap done everything with his claspknife about the cooking  ThenI carried the sack about a hundred yards across the grass and throughthe willows east of the house to a shallow lake that was five mile wideand full of rushesand ducks too you might say in the season  Therewas a slough or a creek leading out of it on the other side that wentmiles away I dont know where but it didnt go to the river  The mealsifted out and made a little track all the way to the lake  I droppedpaps whetstone there too so as to look like it had been done byaccident Then I tied up the rip in the meal sack with a string so itwouldnt leak no more and took it and my saw to the canoe againIt was about dark now so I dropped the canoe down the river under somewillows that hung over the bank and waited for the moon to rise  Imade fast to a willow then I took a bite to eat and by and by laiddown in the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan  I says to myselftheyll follow the track of that sackful of rocks to the shore and thendrag the river for me  And theyll follow that meal track to the lakeand go browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find the robbersthat killed me and took the things  They wont ever hunt the river foranything but my dead carcass Theyll soon get tired of that and wontbother no more about me  All right I can stop anywhere I want toJacksons Island is good enough for me I know that island pretty welland nobody ever comes there  And then I can paddle over to town nightsand slink around and pick up things I want Jacksons Islands theplaceI was pretty tired and the first thing I knowed I was asleep  WhenI woke up I didnt know where I was for a minute  I set up and lookedaround a little scared  Then I remembered  The river looked miles andmiles across  The moon was so bright I could a counted the drift logsthat went aslipping along black and still hundreds of yards out fromshore Everything was dead quiet and it looked late and smelt lateYou know what I meanI dont know the words to put it inI took a good gap and a stretch and was just going to unhitch and startwhen I heard a sound away over the water  I listened  Pretty soon Imade it out  It was that dull kind of a regular sound that comes fromoars working in rowlocks when its a still night  I peeped out throughthe willow branches and there it wasa skiff away across the water I couldnt tell how many was in it  It kept acoming and when it wasabreast of me I see there warnt but one man in it  Thinks I maybeits pap though I warnt expecting him  He dropped below me with thecurrent and by and by he came aswinging up shore in the easy waterand he went by so close I could a reached out the gun and touched him Well it was pap sure enoughand sober too by the way he laid hisoarsI didnt lose no time  The next minute I was aspinning down streamsoft but quick in the shade of the bank  I made two mile and a halfand then struck out a quarter of a mile or more towards the middle ofthe river because pretty soon I would be passing the ferry landing andpeople might see me and hail me  I got out amongst the driftwood andthen laid down in the bottom of the canoe and let her float I laid there and had a good rest and a smoke out of my pipe lookingaway into the sky not a cloud in it  The sky looks ever so deep whenyou lay down on your back in the moonshine I never knowed it before And how far a body can hear on the water such nights  I heard peopletalking at the ferry landing I heard what they said tooevery wordof it  One man said it was getting towards the long days and the shortnights now  Tother one said this warnt one of the short ones hereckonedand then they laughed and he said it over again and theylaughed again then they waked up another fellow and told him andlaughed but he didnt laugh he ripped out something brisk and saidlet him alone  The first fellow said he lowed to tell it to hisold womanshe would think it was pretty good but he said that warntnothing to some things he had said in his time I heard one man say itwas nearly three oclock and he hoped daylight wouldnt wait more thanabout a week longer  After that the talk got further and further awayand I couldnt make out the words any more but I could hear the mumbleand now and then a laugh too but it seemed a long ways offI was away below the ferry now  I rose up and there was JacksonsIsland about two mile and a half down stream heavy timbered andstanding up out of the middle of the river big and dark and solid likea steamboat without any lights  There warnt any signs of the bar atthe headit was all under water nowIt didnt take me long to get there  I shot past the head at a rippingrate the current was so swift and then I got into the dead water andlanded on the side towards the Illinois shore  I run the canoe intoa deep dent in the bank that I knowed about I had to part the willowbranches to get in and when I made fast nobody could a seen the canoefrom the outsideI went up and set down on a log at the head of the island and lookedout on the big river and the black driftwood and away over to the townthree mile away where there was three or four lights twinkling  Amonstrous big lumberraft was about a mile up stream coming along downwith a lantern in the middle of it  I watched it come creeping downand when it was most abreast of where I stood I heard a man say Sternoars there heave her head to stabboard  I heard that just as plainas if the man was by my sideThere was a little gray in the sky now so I stepped into the woods andlaid down for a nap before breakfastCHAPTER VIIITHE sun was up so high when I waked that I judged it was after eightoclock  I laid there in the grass and the cool shade thinking aboutthings and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and satisfied  Icould see the sun out at one or two holes but mostly it was big treesall about and gloomy in there amongst them  There was freckled placeson the ground where the light sifted down through the leaves and thefreckled places swapped about a little showing there was a littlebreeze up there  A couple of squirrels set on a limb and jabbered at mevery friendlyI was powerful lazy and comfortabledidnt want to get up and cookbreakfast  Well I was dozing off again when I thinks I hears a deepsound of boom away up the river  I rouses up and rests on my elbowand listens pretty soon I hears it again  I hopped up and went andlooked out at a hole in the leaves and I see a bunch of smoke layingon the water a long ways upabout abreast the ferry  And there was theferryboat full of people floating along down  I knowed what was thematter now  Boom I see the white smoke squirt out of the ferryboatsside  You see they was firing cannon over the water trying to make mycarcass come to the topI was pretty hungry but it warnt going to do for me to start a firebecause they might see the smoke  So I set there and watched thecannonsmoke and listened to the boom  The river was a mile wide thereand it always looks pretty on a summer morningso I was having a goodenough time seeing them hunt for my remainders if I only had a bite toeat Well then I happened to think how they always put quicksilver inloaves of bread and float them off because they always go right to thedrownded carcass and stop there  So says I Ill keep a lookout andif any of thems floating around after me Ill give them a show  Ichanged to the Illinois edge of the island to see what luck I couldhave and I warnt disappointed  A big double loaf come along and Imost got it with a long stick but my foot slipped and she floated outfurther  Of course I was where the current set in the closest to theshoreI knowed enough for that  But by and by along comes another oneand this time I won  I took out the plug and shook out the little dabof quicksilver and set my teeth in  It was bakers breadwhat thequality eat none of your lowdown cornponeI got a good place amongst the leaves and set there on a log munchingthe bread and watching the ferryboat and very well satisfied  Andthen something struck me  I says now I reckon the widow or the parsonor somebody prayed that this bread would find me and here it has goneand done it  So there aint no doubt but there is something in thatthingthat is theres something in it when a body like the widow or theparson prays but it dont work for me and I reckon it dont work foronly just the right kindI lit a pipe and had a good long smoke and went on watching  Theferryboat was floating with the current and I allowed Id have a chanceto see who was aboard when she come along because she would come inclose where the bread did  When shed got pretty well along downtowards me I put out my pipe and went to where I fished out the breadand laid down behind a log on the bank in a little open place  Wherethe log forked I could peep throughBy and by she come along and she drifted in so close that they coulda run out a plank and walked ashore  Most everybody was on the boat Pap and Judge Thatcher and Bessie Thatcher and Jo Harper and TomSawyer and his old Aunt Polly and Sid and Mary and plenty more Everybody was talking about the murder but the captain broke in andsaysLook sharp now the current sets in the closest here and maybe heswashed ashore and got tangled amongst the brush at the waters edge  Ihope so anywayI didnt hope so  They all crowded up and leaned over the rails nearlyin my face and kept still watching with all their might  I could seethem firstrate but they couldnt see me  Then the captain sung outStand away and the cannon let off such a blast right before me thatit made me deef with the noise and pretty near blind with the smoke andI judged I was gone  If theyd a had some bullets in I reckon theyda got the corpse they was after  Well I see I warnt hurt thanks togoodness The boat floated on and went out of sight around the shoulderof the island  I could hear the booming now and then further andfurther off and by and by after an hour I didnt hear it no more The island was three mile long  I judged they had got to the foot andwas giving it up  But they didnt yet a while  They turned aroundthe foot of the island and started up the channel on the Missouri sideunder steam and booming once in a while as they went  I crossed overto that side and watched them When they got abreast the head of theisland they quit shooting and dropped over to the Missouri shore andwent home to the townI knowed I was all right now  Nobody else would come ahunting afterme I got my traps out of the canoe and made me a nice camp in the thickwoods  I made a kind of a tent out of my blankets to put my thingsunder so the rain couldnt get at them  I catched a catfish and haggledhim open with my saw and towards sundown I started my camp fire and hadsupper  Then I set out a line to catch some fish for breakfastWhen it was dark I set by my camp fire smoking and feeling pretty wellsatisfied but by and by it got sort of lonesome and so I went and seton the bank and listened to the current swashing along and counted thestars and drift logs and rafts that come down and then went to bedthere aint no better way to put in time when you are lonesome youcant stay so you soon get over itAnd so for three days and nights  No differencejust the same thingBut the next day I went exploring around down through the island  I wasboss of it it all belonged to me so to say and I wanted to knowall about it but mainly I wanted to put in the time  I found plentystrawberries ripe and prime and green summer grapes and greenrazberries and the green blackberries was just beginning to show  Theywould all come handy by and by I judgedWell I went fooling along in the deep woods till I judged I warntfar from the foot of the island  I had my gun along but I hadnt shotnothing it was for protection thought I would kill some game nighhome About this time I mighty near stepped on a goodsized snakeand it went sliding off through the grass and flowers and I afterit trying to get a shot at it I clipped along and all of a sudden Ibounded right on to the ashes of a camp fire that was still smokingMy heart jumped up amongst my lungs  I never waited for to lookfurther but uncocked my gun and went sneaking back on my tiptoes asfast as ever I could  Every now and then I stopped a second amongst thethick leaves and listened but my breath come so hard I couldnt hearnothing else  I slunk along another piece further then listened againand so on and so on  If I see a stump I took it for a man if I trodon a stick and broke it it made me feel like a person had cut one of mybreaths in two and I only got half and the short half tooWhen I got to camp I warnt feeling very brash there warnt much sandin my craw but I says this aint no time to be fooling around  So Igot all my traps into my canoe again so as to have them out of sightand I put out the fire and scattered the ashes around to look like anold last years camp and then clumb a treeI reckon I was up in the tree two hours but I didnt see nothingI didnt hear nothingI only thought I heard and seen as much as athousand things  Well I couldnt stay up there forever so at last Igot down but I kept in the thick woods and on the lookout all thetime All I could get to eat was berries and what was left over frombreakfastBy the time it was night I was pretty hungry  So when it was goodand dark I slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to theIllinois bankabout a quarter of a mile  I went out in the woods andcooked a supper and I had about made up my mind I would stay thereall night when I hear a plunketyplunk plunketyplunk and saysto myself horses coming and next I hear peoples voices  I goteverything into the canoe as quick as I could and then went creepingthrough the woods to see what I could find out  I hadnt got far when Ihear a man sayWe better camp here if we can find a good place the horses is aboutbeat out  Lets look aroundI didnt wait but shoved out and paddled away easy  I tied up in theold place and reckoned I would sleep in the canoeI didnt sleep much  I couldnt somehow for thinking  And every timeI waked up I thought somebody had me by the neck  So the sleep didntdo me no good  By and by I says to myself I cant live this way Imagoing to find out who it is thats here on the island with me Illfind it out or bust  Well I felt better right offSo I took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two andthen let the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows  The moon wasshining and outside of the shadows it made it most as light as day I poked along well on to an hour everything still as rocks and soundasleep Well by this time I was most down to the foot of the island  Alittle ripply cool breeze begun to blow and that was as good as sayingthe night was about done  I give her a turn with the paddle and brungher nose to shore then I got my gun and slipped out and into the edgeof the woods  I sat down there on a log and looked out through theleaves  I see the moon go off watch and the darkness begin to blanketthe river But in a little while I see a pale streak over the treetopsand knowed the day was coming  So I took my gun and slipped off towardswhere I had run across that camp fire stopping every minute or twoto listen  But I hadnt no luck somehow I couldnt seem to find theplace  But by and by sure enough I catched a glimpse of fire awaythrough the trees  I went for it cautious and slow  By and by I wasclose enough to have a look and there laid a man on the ground  Itmost give me the fantods He had a blanket around his head and hishead was nearly in the fire  I set there behind a clump of bushes inabout six foot of him and kept my eyes on him steady  It was gettinggray daylight now  Pretty soon he gapped and stretched himself and hoveoff the blanket and it was Miss Watsons Jim  I bet I was glad to seehim  I saysHello Jim and skipped outHe bounced up and stared at me wild  Then he drops down on his kneesand puts his hands together and saysDoan hurt medont  I haint ever done no harm to a ghos  I alwuzliked dead people en done all I could for em  You go en git in deriver agin whah you blongs en doan do nuffn to Ole Jim at uzawluz yo frenWell I warnt long making him understand I warnt dead  I was ever soglad to see Jim  I warnt lonesome now  I told him I warnt afraid ofhim telling the people where I was  I talked along but he only setthere and looked

the canoe was and while he built a fire ina grassy open place amongst the trees I fetched meal and bacon andcoffee and coffeepot and fryingpan and sugar and tin cups and thenigger was set back considerable because he reckoned it was all donewith witchcraft I catched a good big catfish too and Jim cleaned himwith his knife and fried himWhen breakfast was ready we lolled on the grass and eat

the islandthat Id found when I was exploring so we started and soon got to itbecause the island was only three miles long and a quarter of a milewideThis place was a tolerable long steep hill or ridge about forty foothigh We had a rough time getting to the top the sides was so steep andthe bushes so thick  We tramped and clumb around all over it and byand by found a good big cavern in the rock most up to the top on theside towards Illinois  The cavern was as big as two or three roomsbunched together and Jim could stand up straight in it  It was cool inthere Jim was for putting our traps in there right away but I said wedidnt want to be climbing up and down there all the timeJim said if we had the canoe hid in a good place and had all the trapsin the cavern we could rush there if anybody was to come to the islandand they would never find us without dogs  And besides he said themlittle birds had said it was going to rain and did I want the things toget wetSo we went back and got the canoe and paddled up abreast the cavernand lugged all the traps up there  Then we hunted up a place close byto hide the canoe in amongst the thick willows  We took some fish offof the lines and set them again and begun to get ready for dinnerThe door of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in and on oneside of the door the floor stuck out a little bit and was flat and agood place to build a fire on  So we built it there and cooked dinnerWe spread the blankets inside for a carpet and eat our dinner in thereWe put all the other things handy at the back of the cavern  Prettysoon it darkened up and begun to thunder and lighten so the birds wasright about it  Directly it begun to rain and it rained like all furytoo and I never see the wind blow so  It was one of these regularsummer storms  It would get so dark that it looked all blueblackoutside and lovely and the rain would thrash along by so thick thatthe trees off a little ways looked dim and spiderwebby and here wouldcome a blast of wind that would bend the trees down and turn up thepale underside of the leaves and then a perfect ripper of a gust wouldfollow along and set the branches to tossing their arms as if theywas just wild and next when it was just about the bluest andblackestFST it was as bright as glory and youd have a littleglimpse of treetops aplunging about away off yonder in the stormhundreds of yards further than you could see before dark as sin againin a second and now youd hear the thunder let go with an awful crashand then go rumbling grumbling tumbling down the sky towards theunder side of the world like rolling empty barrels down stairswhereits long stairs and they bounce a good deal you knowJim this is nice I says  I wouldnt want to be nowhere else buthere Pass me along another hunk of fish and some hot cornbreadWell you wouldnt a ben here f it hadnt a ben for Jim  Youd a bendown dah in de woods widout any dinner en gittn mos drownded toodat you would honey  Chickens knows when its gwyne to rain en so dode birds chileThe river went on raising and raising for ten or twelve days till atlast it was over the banks  The water was three or four foot deep onthe island in the low places and on the Illinois bottom  On that sideit was a good many miles wide but on the Missouri side it was the sameold distance acrossa half a milebecause the Missouri shore was just awall of high bluffsDaytimes we paddled all over the island in the canoe It was mighty cooland shady in the deep woods even if the sun was blazing outside  Wewent winding in and out amongst the trees and sometimes the vines hungso thick we had to back away and go some other way  Well on every oldbrokendown tree you could see rabbits and snakes and such things andwhen the island had been overflowed a day or two they got so tame onaccount of being hungry that you could paddle right up and put yourhand on them if you wanted to but not the snakes and turtlesthey wouldslide off in the water  The ridge our cavern was in was full of themWe could a had pets enough if wed wanted themOne night we catched a little section of a lumber raftnice pine planksIt was twelve foot wide and about fifteen or sixteen foot long andthe top stood above water six or seven inchesa solid level floor  Wecould see sawlogs go by in the daylight sometimes but we let them gowe didnt show ourselves in daylightAnother night when we was up at the head of the island just beforedaylight here comes a framehouse down on the west side  She wasa twostory and tilted over considerable  We paddled out and gotaboardclumb in at an upstairs window  But it was too dark to see yetso we made the canoe fast and set in her to wait for daylightThe light begun to come before we got to the foot of the island  Thenwe looked in at the window  We could make out a bed and a table andtwo old chairs and lots of things around about on the floor and therewas clothes hanging against the wall  There was something laying on thefloor in the far corner that looked like a man  So Jim saysHello youBut it didnt budge  So I hollered again and then Jim saysDe man aint asleephes dead  You hold stillIll go en seeHe went and bent down and looked and saysIts a dead man  Yes indeedy naked too  Hes ben shot in de backI reckn hes ben dead two er three days  Come in Huck but doan lookat his faceits too gashlyI didnt look at him at all  Jim throwed some old rags over him buthe neednt done it I didnt want to see him  There was heaps of oldgreasy cards scattered around over the floor and old whisky bottlesand a couple of masks made out of black cloth and all over the wallswas the ignorantest kind of words and pictures made with charcoal There was two old dirty calico dresses and a sunbonnet and somewomens underclothes hanging against the wall and some mens clothingtoo  We put the lot into the canoeit might come good  There was aboys old speckled straw hat on the floor I took that too  And therewas a bottle that had had milk in it and it had a rag stopper for ababy to suck  We would a took the bottle but it was broke  There wasa seedy old chest and an old hair trunk with the hinges broke  Theystood open but there warnt nothing left in them that was any account The way things was scattered about we reckoned the people left in ahurry and warnt fixed so as to carry off most of their stuffWe got an old tin lantern and a butcherknife without any handle anda brannew Barlow knife worth two bits in any store and a lot of tallowcandles and a tin candlestick and a gourd and a tin cup and a rattyold bedquilt off the bed and a reticule with needles and pins andbeeswax and buttons and thread and all such truck in it and a hatchetand some nails and a fishline as thick as my little finger with somemonstrous hooks on it and a roll of buckskin and a leather dogcollarand a horseshoe and some vials of medicine that didnt have no labelon them and just as we was leaving I found a tolerable good currycomband Jim he found a ratty old fiddlebow and a wooden leg  The strapswas broke off of it but barring that it was a good enough leg thoughit was too long for me and not long enough for Jim and we couldnt findthe other one though we hunted all aroundAnd so take it all around we made a good haul  When we was ready toshove off we was a quarter of a mile below the island and it was prettybroad day so I made Jim lay down in the canoe and cover up with thequilt because if he set up people could tell he was a nigger a goodways off  I paddled over to the Illinois shore and drifted down mosta half a mile doing it  I crept up the dead water under the bank andhadnt no accidents and didnt see nobody  We got home all safeCHAPTER XAFTER breakfast I wanted to talk about the dead man and guess out how hecome to be killed but Jim didnt want to  He said it would fetch badluck and besides he said he might come and hant us he said a manthat warnt buried was more likely to go ahanting around than onethat was planted and comfortable  That sounded pretty reasonable soI didnt say no more but I couldnt keep from studying over it andwishing I knowed who shot the man and what they done it forWe rummaged the clothes wed got and found eight dollars in silversewed up in the lining of an old blanket overcoat  Jim said he reckonedthe people in that house stole the coat because if theyd a knowed themoney was there they wouldnt a left it  I said I reckoned they killedhim too but Jim didnt want to talk about that  I saysNow you think its bad luck but what did you say when I fetched in thesnakeskin that I found on the top of the ridge day before yesterdayYou said it was the worst bad luck in the world to touch a snakeskinwith my hands  Well heres your bad luck  Weve raked in all thistruck and eight dollars besides  I wish we could have some bad lucklike this every day JimNever you mind honey never you mind  Dont you git too peart  Itsacomin  Mind I tell you its acominIt did come too  It was a Tuesday that we had that talk  Well afterdinner Friday we was laying around in the grass at the upper end of theridge and got out of tobacco  I went to the cavern to get some andfound a rattlesnake in there  I killed him and curled him up on thefoot of Jims blanket ever so natural thinking thered be some funwhen Jim found him there  Well by night I forgot all about the snakeand when Jim flung himself down on the blanket while I struck a lightthe snakes mate was there and bit himHe jumped up yelling and the first thing the light showed was thevarmint curled up and ready for another spring  I laid him out in asecond with a stick and Jim grabbed paps whiskyjug and begun to pourit downHe was barefooted and the snake bit him right on the heel  That allcomes of my being such a fool as to not remember that wherever you leavea dead snake its mate always comes there and curls around it  Jim toldme to chop off the snakes head and throw it away and then skin thebody and roast a piece of it  I done it and he eat it and said itwould help cure him He made me take off the rattles and tie them aroundhis wrist too  He said that that would help  Then I slid out quietand throwed the snakes clear away amongst the bushes for I warnt goingto let Jim find out it was all my fault not if I could help itJim sucked and sucked at the jug and now and then he got out of hishead and pitched around and yelled but every time he come to himself hewent to sucking at the jug again  His foot swelled up pretty big andso did his leg but by and by the drunk begun to come and so I judgedhe was all right but Id druther been bit with a snake than papswhiskyJim was laid up for four days and nights  Then the swelling was allgone and he was around again  I made up my mind I wouldnt ever takeaholt of a snakeskin again with my hands now that I see what had comeof it Jim said he reckoned I would believe him next time  And he saidthat handling a snakeskin was such awful bad luck that maybe we hadntgot to the end of it yet  He said he druther see the new moon over hisleft shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a snakeskinin his hand  Well I was getting to feel that way myself though Ivealways reckoned that looking at the new moon over your left shoulder isone of the carelessest and foolishest things a body can do  Old HankBunker done it once and bragged about it and in less than two years hegot drunk and fell off of the shottower and spread himself out sothat he was just a kind of a layer as you may say and they slid himedgeways between two barn doors for a coffin and buried him so sothey say but I didnt see it  Pap told me  But anyway it all come oflooking at the moon that way like a foolWell the days went along and the river went down between its banksagain and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the bighooks with a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that wasas big as a man being six foot two inches long and weighed over twohundred pounds We couldnt handle him of course he would a flung usinto Illinois  We just set there and watched him rip and tear aroundtill he drownded  We found a brass button in his stomach and a roundball and lots of rubbage  We split the ball open with the hatchetand there was a spool in it  Jim said hed had it there a long time tocoat it over so and make a ball of it  It was as big a fish as was evercatched in the Mississippi I reckon  Jim said he hadnt ever seena bigger one  He would a been worth a good deal over at the village They peddle out such a fish as that by the pound in the markethousethere everybody buys some of him his meats as white as snow and makesa good fryNext morning I said it was getting slow and dull and I wanted to get astirring up some way  I said I reckoned I would slip over the river andfind out what was going on  Jim liked that notion but he said Imust go in the dark and look sharp  Then he studied it over and saidcouldnt I put on some of them old things and dress up like a girl That was a good notion too  So we shortened up one of the calicogowns and I turned up my trouserlegs to my knees and got into it  Jimhitched it behind with the hooks and it was a fair fit  I put on thesunbonnet and tied it under my chin and then for a body to look inand see my face was like looking down a joint of stovepipe  Jim saidnobody would know me even in the daytime hardly  I practiced aroundall day to get the hang of the things and by and by I could do prettywell in them only Jim said I didnt walk like a girl and he saidI must quit pulling up my gown to get at my britchespocket  I tooknotice and done betterI started up the Illinois shore in the canoe just after darkI started across to the town from a little below the ferrylanding andthe drift of the current fetched me in at the bottom of the town  Itied up and started along the bank  There was a light burning in alittle shanty that hadnt been lived in for a long time and I wonderedwho had took up quarters there  I slipped up and peeped in at thewindow  There was a woman about forty year old in there knitting bya candle that was on a pine table  I didnt know her face she was astranger for you couldnt start a face in that town that I didnt know Now this was lucky because I was weakening I was getting afraid I hadcome people might know my voice and find me out  But if this woman hadbeen in such a little town two days she could tell me all I wanted toknow so I knocked at the door and made up my mind I wouldnt forget Iwas a girlCHAPTER XICOME in says the woman and I did  She says  Take a cheerI done it  She looked me all over with her little shiny eyes and saysWhat might your name beSarah WilliamsWhere bouts do you live  In this neighborhoodNom  In Hookerville seven mile below  Ive walked all the way andIm all tired outHungry too I reckon  Ill find you somethingNom I aint hungry  I was so hungry I had to stop two miles belowhere at a farm so I aint hungry no more  Its what makes me so lateMy mothers down sick and out of money and everything and I come totell my uncle Abner Moore  He lives at the upper end of the town shesays  I haint ever been here before  Do you know himNo but I dont know everybody yet  I havent lived here quite twoweeks Its a considerable ways to the upper end of the town  Youbetter stay here all night  Take off your bonnetNo I says Ill rest a while I reckon and go on  I aint afearedof the darkShe said she wouldnt let me go by myself but her husband would be inby and by maybe in a hour and a half and shed send him along with meThen she got to talking about her husband and about her relations upthe river and her relations down the river and about how much betteroff they used to was and how they didnt know but theyd made a mistakecoming to our town instead of letting well aloneand so on and so ontill I was afeard I had made a mistake coming to her to find out whatwas going on in the town but by and by she dropped on to pap and themurder and then I was pretty willing to let her clatter right along She told about me and Tom Sawyer finding the six thousand dollars onlyshe got it ten and all about pap and what a hard lot he was and whata hard lot I was and at last she got down to where I was murdered  IsaysWho done it  Weve heard considerable about these goings on down inHookerville but we dont know who twas that killed Huck FinnWell I reckon theres a right smart chance of people here thatdlike to know who killed him  Some think old Finn done it himselfNois that soMost everybody thought it at first  Hell never know how nigh he cometo getting lynched  But before night they changed around and judged itwas done by a runaway nigger named JimWhy heI stopped  I reckoned I better keep still  She run on and nevernoticed I had put in at allThe nigger run off the very night Huck Finn was killed  So theres areward out for himthree hundred dollars  And theres a reward out forold Finn tootwo hundred dollars  You see he come to town themorning after the murder and told about it and was out with em on theferryboat hunt and right away after he up and left  Before night theywanted to lynch him but he was gone you see  Well next day theyfound out the nigger was gone they found out he hadnt ben seen senceten oclock the night the murder was done  So then they put it on himyou see and while they was full of it next day back comes old Finnand went boohooing to Judge Thatcher to get money to hunt for thenigger all over Illinois with The judge gave him some and that eveninghe got drunk and was around till after midnight with a couple of mightyhardlooking strangers and then went off with them  Well he haintcome back sence and they aint looking for him back till this thingblows over a little for people thinks now that he killed his boy andfixed things so folks would think robbers done it and then hed getHucks money without having to bother a long time with a lawsuit People do say he warnt any too good to do it  Oh hes sly I reckon If he dont come back for a year hell be all right  You cant proveanything on him you know everything will be quieted down then andhell walk in Hucks money as easy as nothingYes I reckon so m  I dont see nothing in the way of it  Haseverybody quit thinking the nigger done itOh no not everybody  A good many thinks he done it  But theyll getthe nigger pretty soon now and maybe they can scare it out of himWhy are they after him yetWell youre innocent aint you  Does three hundred dollars layaround every day for people to pick up  Some folks think the niggeraint far from here  Im one of thembut I haint talked it around  Afew days ago I was talking with an old couple that lives next door inthe log shanty and they happened to say hardly anybody ever goes tothat island over yonder that they call Jacksons Island  Dont anybodylive there says I No nobody says they  I didnt say any more butI done some thinking  I was pretty near certain Id seen smoke overthere about the head of the island a day or two before that so I saysto myself like as not that niggers hiding over there anyway saysI its worth the trouble to give the place a hunt  I haint seen anysmoke sence so I reckon maybe hes gone if it was him but husbandsgoing over to seehim and another man  He was gone up the river but hegot back today and I told him as soon as he got here two hours agoI had got so uneasy I couldnt set still  I had to do something with myhands so I took up a needle off of the table and went to threadingit My hands shook and I was making a bad job of it  When the womanstopped talking I looked up and she was looking at me pretty curiousand smiling a little  I put down the needle and thread and let on tobe interestedand I was tooand saysThree hundred dollars is a power of money  I wish my mother could getit Is your husband going over there tonightOh yes  He went uptown with the man I was telling you of to get aboat and see if they could borrow another gun  Theyll go over aftermidnightCouldnt they see better if they was to wait till daytimeYes  And couldnt the nigger see better too  After midnight helllikely be asleep and they can slip around through the woods and hunt uphis camp fire all the better for the dark if hes got oneI didnt think of thatThe woman kept looking at me pretty curious and I didnt feel a bitcomfortable  Pretty soon she saysWhat did you say your name was honeyMMary WilliamsSomehow it didnt seem to me that I said it was Mary before so I didntlook upseemed to me I said it was Sarah so I felt sort of corneredand was afeared maybe I was looking it too  I wished the woman wouldsay something more the longer she set still the uneasier I was  Butnow she saysHoney I thought you said it was Sarah when you first come inOh yesm I did  Sarah Mary Williams  Sarahs my first name  Somecalls me Sarah some calls me MaryOh thats the way of itYesmI was feeling better then but I wished I was out of there anyway  Icouldnt look up yetWell the woman fell to talking about how hard times was and how poorthey had to live and how the rats was as free as if they owned theplace and so forth and so on and then I got easy again  She was rightabout the rats Youd see one stick his nose out of a hole in the cornerevery little while  She said she had to have things handy to throw atthem when she was alone or they wouldnt give her no peace  She showedme a bar of lead twisted up into a knot and said she was a good shotwith it generly but shed wrenched her arm a day or two ago and didntknow whether she could throw true now  But she watched for a chanceand directly banged away at a rat but she missed him wide and saidOuch it hurt her arm so  Then she told me to try for the next one I wanted to be getting away before the old man got back but of courseI didnt let on  I got the thing and the first rat that showed hisnose I let drive and if hed a stayed where he was hed a been atolerable sick rat  She said that was firstrate and she reckoned Iwould hive the next one  She went and got the lump of lead and fetchedit back and brought along a hank of yarn which she wanted me to helpher with  I held up my two hands and she put the hank over them andwent on talking about her and her husbands matters  But she broke offto sayKeep your eye on the rats  You better have the lead in your laphandySo she dropped the lump into my lap just at that moment and I clappedmy legs together on it and she went on talking  But only about aminute Then she took off the hank and looked me straight in the faceand very pleasant and saysCome now whats your real nameWhwhat mumWhats your real name  Is it Bill or Tom or Bobor what is itI reckon I shook like a leaf and I didnt know hardly what to do  ButI saysPlease to dont poke fun at a poor girl like me mum  If Im in theway here IllNo you wont  Set

want him to  You see youre a runawayprentice thats all  It aint anything  There aint no harm in itYouve been treated bad and you made up your mind to cut  Bless youchild I wouldnt tell on you  Tell me all about it now thats a goodboySo I said it wouldnt be no use to try to play it any longer and Iwould just make a clean breast and tell her everything but she musntgo back on her promise  Then I told her my father and mother was deadand the law had bound me out to a mean old farmer in the country thirtymile back from the river and he treated me so bad I couldnt stand itno longer he went away to be gone a couple of days and so I took mychance and stole some of his daughters old clothes and cleared out andI had been three nights coming the thirty miles  I traveled nightsand hid daytimes and slept and the bag of bread and meat I carried fromhome lasted me all the way and I had aplenty  I said I believed myuncle Abner Moore would take care of me and so that was why I struckout for this town of GoshenGoshen child  This aint Goshen  This is St Petersburg  Goshensten mile further up the river  Who told you this was GoshenWhy a man I met at daybreak this morning just as I was going to turninto the woods for my regular sleep  He told me when the roads forked Imust take the right hand and five mile would fetch me to GoshenHe was drunk I reckon  He told you just exactly wrongWell he did act like he was drunk but it aint no matter now  I gotto be moving along  Ill fetch Goshen before daylightHold on a minute  Ill put you up a snack to eat  You might want itSo she put me up a snack and saysSay when a cows laying down which end of her gets up first  Answerup prompt nowdont stop to study over it  Which end gets up firstThe hind end mumWell then a horseThe forrard end mumWhich side of a tree does the moss grow onNorth sideIf fifteen cows is browsing on a hillside how many of them eats withtheir heads pointed the same directionThe whole fifteen mumWell I reckon you have lived in the country  I thought maybe youwas trying to hocus me again  Whats your real name nowGeorge Peters mumWell try to remember it George  Dont forget and tell me itsElexander before you go and then get out by saying its GeorgeElexander when I catch you  And dont go about women in that oldcalico  You do a girl tolerable poor but you might fool men maybe Bless you child when you set out to thread a needle dont hold thethread still and fetch the needle up to it hold the needle still andpoke the thread at it thats the way a woman most always does but aman always does tother way  And when you throw at a rat or anythinghitch yourself up a tiptoe and fetch your hand up over your head asawkward as you can and miss your rat about six or seven foot Throwstiffarmed from the shoulder like there was a pivot there for it toturn on like a girl not from the wrist and elbow with your arm outto one side like a boy  And mind you when a girl tries to catchanything in her lap she throws her knees apart she dont clap themtogether the way you did when you catched the lump of lead  Why Ispotted you for a boy when you was threading the needle and I contrivedthe other things just to make certain  Now trot along to your uncleSarah Mary Williams George Elexander Peters and if you get into troubleyou send word to Mrs Judith Loftus which is me and Ill do what I canto get you out of it  Keep the river road all the way and next timeyou tramp take shoes and socks with you The river roads a rocky oneand your feetll be in a condition when you get to Goshen I reckonI went up the bank about fifty yards and then I doubled on my tracksand slipped back to where my canoe was a good piece below the house  Ijumped in and was off in a hurry  I went upstream far enough tomake the head of the island and then started across  I took off thesunbonnet for I didnt want no blinders on then  When I was about themiddle I heard the clock begin to strike so I stops and listens thesound come faint over the water but cleareleven  When I struck thehead of the island I never waited to blow though I was most winded butI shoved right into the timber where my old camp used to be and starteda good fire there on a high and dry spotThen I jumped in the canoe and dug out for our place a mile and a halfbelow as hard as I could go  I landed and slopped through the timberand up the ridge and into the cavern  There Jim laid sound asleep onthe ground  I roused him out and saysGit up and hump yourself Jim  There aint a minute to lose  Theyreafter usJim never asked no questions he never said a word but the way heworked for the next half an hour showed about how he was scared  Bythat time everything we had in the world was on our raft and she wasready to be shoved out from the willow cove where she was hid  Weput out the camp fire at the cavern the first thing and didnt show acandle outside after thatI took the canoe out from the shore a little piece and took a lookbut if there was a boat around I couldnt see it for stars and shadowsaint good to see by  Then we got out the raft and slipped along downin the shade past the foot of the island dead stillnever saying awordCHAPTER XIIIT must a been close on to one oclock when we got below the island atlast and the raft did seem to go mighty slow  If a boat was to comealong we was going to take to the canoe and break for the Illinoisshore and it was well a boat didnt come for we hadnt ever thought toput the gun in the canoe or a fishingline or anything to eat  Wewas in ruther too much of a sweat to think of so many things  It warntgood judgment to put everything on the raftIf the men went to the island I just expect they found the camp fire Ibuilt and watched it all night for Jim to come  Anyways they stayedaway from us and if my building the fire never fooled them it warnt nofault of mine  I played it as low down on them as I couldWhen the first streak of day began to show we tied up to a towhead in abig bend on the Illinois side and hacked off cottonwood branches withthe hatchet and covered up the raft with them so she looked like therehad been a cavein in the bank there  A towhead is a sandbar that hascottonwoods on it as thick as harrowteethWe had mountains on the Missouri shore and heavy timber on the Illinoisside and the channel was down the Missouri shore at that place so wewarnt afraid of anybody running across us  We laid there all dayand watched the rafts and steamboats spin down the Missouri shore andupbound steamboats fight the big river in the middle  I told Jim allabout the time I had jabbering with that woman and Jim said she wasa smart one and if she was to start after us herself she wouldnt setdown and watch a camp fireno sir shed fetch a dog  Well then Isaid why couldnt she tell her husband to fetch a dog  Jim said hebet she did think of it by the time the men was ready to start and hebelieved they must a gone uptown to get a dog and so they lost all thattime or else we wouldnt be here on a towhead sixteen or seventeen milebelow the villageno indeedy we would be in that same old town again So I said I didnt care what was the reason they didnt get us as longas they didntWhen it was beginning to come on dark we poked our heads out of thecottonwood thicket and looked up and down and across nothing in sightso Jim took up some of the top planks of the raft and built a snugwigwam to get under in blazing weather and rainy and to keep the thingsdry Jim made a floor for the wigwam and raised it a foot or more abovethe level of the raft so now the blankets and all the traps was out ofreach of steamboat waves  Right in the middle of the wigwam we made alayer of dirt about five or six inches deep with a frame around it forto hold it to its place this was to build a fire on in sloppy weatheror chilly the wigwam would keep it from being seen  We made an extrasteeringoar too because one of the others might get broke on a snagor something We fixed up a short forked stick to hang the old lanternon because we must always light the lantern whenever we see a steamboatcoming downstream to keep from getting run over but we wouldnt haveto light it for upstream boats unless we see we was in what they calla crossing for the river was pretty high yet very low banks beingstill a little under water so upbound boats didnt always run thechannel but hunted easy waterThis second night we run between seven and eight hours with a currentthat was making over four mile an hour  We catched fish and talkedand we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness  It was kind ofsolemn drifting down the big still river laying on our backs lookingup at the stars and we didnt ever feel like talking loud and itwarnt often that we laughedonly a little kind of a low chuckle  Wehad mighty good weather as a general thing and nothing ever happened tous at allthat night nor the next nor the nextEvery night we passed towns some of them away up on black hillsidesnothing but just a shiny bed of lights not a house could you see  Thefifth night we passed St Louis and it was like the whole world lit upIn St Petersburg they used to say there was twenty or thirty thousandpeople in St Louis but I never believed it till I see that wonderfulspread of lights at two oclock that still night  There warnt a soundthere everybody was asleepEvery night now I used to slip ashore towards ten oclock at some littlevillage and buy ten or fifteen cents worth of meal or bacon or otherstuff to eat and sometimes I lifted a chicken that warnt roostingcomfortable and took him along  Pap always said take a chicken whenyou get a chance because if you dont want him yourself you can easyfind somebody that does and a good deed aint ever forgot  I never seepap when he didnt want the chicken himself but that is what he used tosay anywayMornings before daylight I slipped into cornfields and borrowed awatermelon or a mushmelon or a punkin or some new corn or things ofthat kind  Pap always said it warnt no harm to borrow things if youwas meaning to pay them back some time but the widow said it warntanything but a soft name for stealing and no decent body would do it Jim said he reckoned the widow was partly right and pap was partlyright so the best way would be for us to pick out two or three thingsfrom the list and say we wouldnt borrow them any morethen he reckonedit wouldnt be no harm to borrow the others  So we talked it over allone night drifting along down the river trying to make up our mindswhether to drop the watermelons or the cantelopes or the mushmelonsor what  But towards daylight we got it all settled satisfactory andconcluded to drop crabapples and psimmons  We warnt feeling justright before that but it was all comfortable now  I was glad the wayit come out too because crabapples aint ever good and the psimmonswouldnt be ripe for two or three months yetWe shot a waterfowl now and then that got up too early in the morningor didnt go to bed early enough in the evening  Take it all round welived pretty highThe fifth night below St Louis we had a big storm after midnight witha power of thunder and lightning and the rain poured down in a solidsheet We stayed in the wigwam and let the raft take care of itselfWhen the lightning glared out we could see a big straight river aheadand high rocky bluffs on both sides  By and by says I Hello Jimlooky yonder It was a steamboat that had killed herself on a rock We was drifting straight down for her  The lightning showed her verydistinct  She was leaning over with part of her upper deck abovewater and you could see every little chimblyguy clean and clear and achair by the big bell with an old slouch hat hanging on the back of itwhen the flashes comeWell it being away in the night and stormy and all so mysteriouslikeI felt just the way any other boy would a felt when I see that wrecklaying there so mournful and lonesome in the middle of the river  Iwanted to get aboard of her and slink around a little and see whatthere was there  So I saysLes land on her JimBut Jim was dead against it at first  He saysI doan want to go fooln long er no wrack  Wes doin blame wellen we better let blame well alone as de good book says  Like as notdeys a watchman on dat wrackWatchman your grandmother I says there aint nothing to watch butthe texas and the pilothouse and do you reckon anybodys going to reskhis life for a texas and a pilothouse such a night as this whenits likely to break up and wash off down the river any minute  Jimcouldnt say nothing to that so he didnt try  And besides I sayswe might borrow something worth having out of the captains stateroom Seegars I bet youand cost five cents apiece solid cash  Steamboatcaptains is always rich and get sixty dollars a month and they dontcare a cent what a thing costs you know long as they want it  Stick acandle in your pocket I cant rest Jim till we give her a rummaging Do you reckon Tom Sawyer would ever go by this thing  Not for pie hewouldnt Hed call it an adventurethats what hed call it and hedland on that wreck if it was his last act  And wouldnt he throw styleinto itwouldnt he spread himself nor nothing  Why youd think itwas Christopher Clumbus discovering KingdomCome  I wish Tom Sawyerwas hereJim he grumbled a little but give in  He said we mustnt talk any morethan we could help and then talk mighty low  The lightning showed usthe wreck again just in time and we fetched the stabboard derrick andmade fast thereThe deck was high out here  We went sneaking down the slope of it tolabboard in the dark towards the texas feeling our way slow with ourfeet and spreading our hands out to fend off the guys for it was sodark we couldnt see no sign of them  Pretty soon we struck the forwardend of the skylight and clumb on to it and the next step fetched us infront of the captains door which was open and by Jimminy away downthrough the texashall we see a light and all in the same second weseem to hear low voices in yonderJim whispered and said he was feeling powerful sick and told me to comealong  I says all right and was going to start for the raft but justthen I heard a voice wail out and sayOh please dont boys I swear I wont ever tellAnother voice said pretty loudIts a lie Jim Turner  Youve acted this way before  You always wantmoren your share of the truck and youve always got it too becauseyouve swore t if you didnt youd tell  But this time youve saidit jest one time too many  Youre the meanest treacherousest hound inthis countryBy this time Jim was gone for the raft  I was just abiling withcuriosity and I says to myself Tom Sawyer wouldnt back out nowand so I wont either Im agoing to see whats going on here  So Idropped on my hands and knees in the little passage and crept aftin the dark till there warnt but one stateroom betwixt me and thecrosshall of the texas  Then in there I see a man stretched on thefloor and tied hand and foot and two men standing over him and oneof them had a dim lantern in his hand and the other one had a pistol This one kept pointing the pistol at the mans head on the floor andsayingId like to  And I orter tooa mean skunkThe man on the floor would shrivel up and say Oh please dont BillI haint ever goin to tellAnd every time he said that the man with the lantern would laugh andsayDeed you aint  You never said no truer thing n that you betyou And once he said  Hear him beg and yit if we hadnt got thebest of him and tied him hed a killed us both  And what for  Jistfor nothn Jist because we stood on our rightsthats what for  ButI lay you aint agoin to threaten nobody any more Jim Turner  Putup that pistol BillBill saysI dont want to Jake Packard  Im for killin himand didnt he killold Hatfield jist the same wayand dont he deserve itBut I dont want him killed and Ive got my reasons for itBless yo heart for them words Jake Packard  Ill never forgit youlongs I live says the man on the floor sort of blubberingPackard didnt take no notice of that but hung up his lantern on a nailand started towards where I was there in the dark and motioned Billto come  I crawfished as fast as I could about two yards but the boatslanted so that I couldnt make very good time so to keep from gettingrun over and catched I crawled into a stateroom on the upper side The man came apawing along in the dark and when Packard got to mystateroom he saysHerecome in hereAnd in he come and Bill after him  But before they got in I was upin the upper berth cornered and sorry I come  Then they stood therewith their hands on the ledge of the berth and talked  I couldnt seethem but I could tell where they was by the whisky theyd been having I was glad I didnt drink whisky but it wouldnt made much differenceanyway because most of the time they couldnt a treed me because Ididnt breathe  I was too scared  And besides a body couldntbreathe and hear such talk  They talked low and earnest  Bill wantedto kill Turner  He saysHes said hell tell and he will  If we was to give both our sharesto him now it wouldnt make no difference after the row and the wayweve served him  Shores youre born hell turn States evidence nowyou hear me  Im for putting him out of his troublesSom I says Packard very quietBlame it Id sorter begun to think you wasnt  Well then thats allright  Les go and do itHold on a minute I haint had my say yit  You listen to meShootings good but theres quieter ways if the things got to bedone But what I say is this  it aint good sense to go courtn aroundafter a halter if you can git at what youre up to in some way thatsjist as good and at the same time dont bring you into no resks  Aintthat soYou bet it is  But how you goin to manage it this timeWell my idea is this  well rustle around and gather up whateverpickins weve overlooked in the staterooms and shove for shore and hidethe truck Then well wait  Now I say it aint agoin to be moren twohours befo this wrack breaks up and washes off down the river  SeeHell be drownded and wont have nobody to blame for it but his ownself  I reckon thats a considerble sight better n killin of him Im unfavorable to killin a man as long as you can git aroun it itaint good sense it aint good morals  Aint I rightYes I reckn you are  But spose she dont break up and wash offWell we can wait the two hours anyway and see cant weAll right then come alongSo they started and I lit out all in a cold sweat and scrambledforward It was dark as pitch there but I said in a kind of a coarsewhisper Jim and he answered up right at my elbow with a sort of amoan and I saysQuick Jim it aint no time for fooling around and moaning theres agang of murderers in yonder and if we dont hunt up their boat and sether drifting down the river so these fellows cant get away from thewreck theres one of em going to be in a bad fix  But if we find theirboat we can put all of em in a bad fixfor the sheriff ll get emQuickhurry  Ill hunt the labboard side you hunt the stabboard Youstart at the raft andOh my lordy lordy  raf  Dey ain no raf no mo she done brokeloose en gone Ien here we isCHAPTER XIIIWELL I catched my breath and most fainted  Shut up on a wreck withsuch a gang as that  But it warnt no time to be sentimentering  Wedgot to find that boat nowhad to have it for ourselves  So we wentaquaking and shaking down the stabboard side and slow work it wastooseemed a week before we got to the stern  No sign of a boat  Jimsaid he didnt believe he could go any furtherso scared he hadnthardly any strength left he said  But I said come on if we get lefton this wreck we are in a fix sure  So on we prowled again  We struckfor the stern of the texas and found it and then scrabbled alongforwards on the skylight hanging on from shutter to shutter for theedge of the skylight was in the water  When we got pretty close to thecrosshall door there was the skiff sure enough  I could just barelysee her  I felt ever so thankful  In another second I would a beenaboard of her but just then the door opened  One of the men stuck hishead out only about a couple of foot from me and I thought I was gonebut he jerked it in again and saysHeave that blame lantern out o sight BillHe flung a bag of something into the boat and then got in himself andset down  It was Packard  Then Bill he come out and got in  Packardsays in a low voiceAll readyshove offI couldnt hardly hang on to the shutters I was so weak  But BillsaysHold ond you go through himNo  Didnt youNo  So hes got his share o the cash yetWell then come along no use to take truck and leave moneySay wont he suspicion what were up toMaybe he wont  But we got to have it anyway Come alongSo they got out and went inThe door slammed to because it was on the careened side and in a halfsecond I was in the boat and Jim come tumbling after me  I out with myknife and cut the rope and away we wentWe didnt touch an oar and we didnt speak nor whisper nor hardly evenbreathe  We went gliding swift along dead silent past the tip of thepaddlebox and past the stern then in a second or two more we was ahundred yards below the wreck and the darkness soaked her up everylast sign of her and we was safe and knowed itWhen we was three or four hundred yards downstream we see the lanternshow like a little spark at the texas door for a second and we knowedby that that the rascals had missed their boat and was beginning tounderstand that they was in just as much trouble now as Jim Turner wasThen Jim manned the oars and we took out after our raft  Now was thefirst time that I begun to worry about the menI reckon I hadnthad time to before  I begun to think how dreadful it was even formurderers to be in such a fix  I says to myself there aint notelling but I might come to be a murderer myself yet and then how wouldI like it  So says I to JimThe first light we see well land a hundred yards below it or aboveit in a place where its a good hidingplace for you and the skiff andthen Ill go and fix up some kind of a yarn and get somebody to go forthat gang and get them out of their scrape so they can be hung whentheir time comesBut that idea was a failure for pretty soon it begun to storm againand this time worse than ever  The rain poured down and never a lightshowed everybody in bed I reckon  We boomed along down the riverwatching for lights and watching for our raft  After a long time therain let up but the clouds stayed and the lightning kept whimperingand by and by a flash showed us a black thing ahead floating and wemade for itIt was the raft and mighty glad was we to get aboard of it again  Weseen a light now away down to the right on shore  So I said I wouldgo for it The skiff was half full of plunder which that gang had stolethere on the wreck  We hustled it on to the raft in a pile and I toldJim to float along down and show a light when he judged he had goneabout two mile and keep it burning till I come then I manned my oarsand shoved for the light  As I got down towards it three or four moreshowedup on a hillside  It was a village  I closed in above the shorelight and laid on my oars and floated  As I went by I see it was alantern hanging on the jackstaff of a doublehull ferryboat  I skimmedaround for the watchman awondering whereabouts he slept and by andby I found him roosting on the bitts forward with his head down betweenhis knees  I gave his shoulder two or three little shoves and begun tocryHe stirred up in a kind of a startlish way but when he see it was onlyme he took a good gap and stretch and then he saysHello whats up  Dont cry bub  Whats the troubleI saysPap and mam and sis andThen I broke down  He saysOh dang it now dont take on so we all has to have our troublesand this n ll come out all right  Whats the matter with emTheyretheyreare you the watchman of the boatYes he says kind of prettywellsatisfied like  Im the captainand the owner and the mate and the pilot and watchman and headdeckhand and sometimes Im the freight and passengers  I aint asrich as old Jim Hornback and I cant be so blame generous and goodto Tom Dick and Harry as what he is and slam around money the way hedoes but Ive told him a many a time t I wouldnt trade places withhim for says I a sailors lifes the life for me and Im derned ifId live two mile out o town where there aint nothing ever goinon not for all his spondulicks and as much more on top of it  Says II broke in and saysTheyre in an awful peck of trouble andWho isWhy pap and mam and sis and Miss Hooker and if youd take yourferryboat and go up thereUp where  Where are theyOn the wreckWhat wreckWhy there aint but oneWhat you dont mean the Walter ScottYesGood land what are they doin there for gracious sakesWell they didnt go there apurposeI bet they didnt  Why great goodness there aint no chance for emif they dont git off mighty quick  Why how in the nation did theyever git into such a scrapeEasy enough  Miss Hooker was avisiting up there to the townYes Booths Landinggo onShe was avisiting there at Booths Landing and just in the edge ofthe evening she started over with her nigger woman in the horseferryto stay all night at her friends house Miss Whatyoumaycallher Idisremember her nameand they lost their steeringoar and swungaround and went afloating down stern first about two mile andsaddlebaggsed on the wreck and the ferryman and the nigger woman andthe horses was all lost but Miss Hooker she made a grab and got aboardthe wreck  Well about an hour after dark we come along down in ourtradingscow and it was so dark we didnt notice the wreck till we wasright on it and so we saddlebaggsed but all of us was saved butBill Whippleand oh he was the best creturI most wish t it hadbeen me I doMy George  Its the beatenest thing I ever struck  And then whatdid you all doWell we hollered and took on but its so wide there we couldntmake nobody hear  So pap said somebody got to get ashore and get helpsomehow I was the only one that could swim so I made a dash for itand Miss Hooker she said if I didnt strike help sooner come here andhunt up her uncle and hed fix the thing  I made the land about a milebelow and been fooling along ever since trying to get people to dosomething but they said What in such a night and such a currentThere aint no sense in it go for the steam ferry  Now if youll goandBy Jackson Id like to and blame it I dont know but I will butwho in the dingnations agoing to pay for it  Do you reckon yourpapWhy thats all right  Miss Hooker she tole me particular thather uncle HornbackGreat guns is he her uncle  Looky here you break for that lightover yonderway and turn out west when you git there and about aquarter of a mile out youll come to the tavern tell em to dart youout to Jim Hornbacks and hell foot the bill  And dont you foolaround any because hell want to know the news  Tell him Ill havehis niece all safe before he can get to town  Hump yourself now Imagoing up around the corner here to roust out my engineerI struck for the light but as soon as he turned the corner I went backand got into my skiff and bailed her out and then pulled up shore inthe easy water about six hundred yards and tucked myself in amongsome woodboats for I couldnt rest easy till I could see the ferryboatstart But take it all around I was feeling ruther comfortable onaccounts of taking all this trouble for that gang for not many woulda done it  I wished the widow knowed about it  I judged she would beproud of me for helping these rapscallions because rapscallions anddead beats is the kind the widow and good people takes the most interestinWell before long here comes the wreck dim and dusky sliding alongdown A kind of cold shiver went through me and then I struck out forher  She was very deep and I see in a minute there warnt much chancefor anybody being alive in her  I pulled all around her and hollereda little but there wasnt any answer all dead still  I felt a littlebit heavyhearted about the gang but not much for I reckoned if theycould stand it I couldThen here comes the ferryboat so I shoved for the middle of the riveron a long downstream slant and when I judged I was out of eyereachI laid on my oars and looked back and see her go and smell around thewreck for Miss Hookers remainders because the captain would know heruncle Hornback would want them and then pretty soon the ferryboat giveit up and went for the shore and I laid into my work and went aboomingdown the riverIt did seem a powerful long time before Jims light showed up and whenit did show it looked like it was a thousand mile off  By the time Igot there the sky was beginning to get a little gray in the east so westruck for an island and hid the raft and sunk the skiff and turnedin and slept like dead peopleCHAPTER XIVBY and by when we got up we turned over the truck the gang had stoleoff of the wreck and found boots and blankets and clothes and allsorts of other things and a lot of books and a spyglass and threeboxes of seegars  We hadnt ever been this rich before in neither ofour lives  The seegars was prime  We laid off all the afternoon in thewoods talking and me reading the books and having a general goodtime I told Jim all about what happened inside the wreck and at theferryboat and I said these kinds of things was adventures but he saidhe didnt want no more adventures  He said that when I went in thetexas and he crawled back to get on the raft and found her gone henearly died because he judged it was all up with him anyway it couldbe fixed for if he didnt get saved he would get drownded and if hedid get saved whoever saved him would send him back home so as to getthe reward and then Miss Watson would sell him South sure  Well hewas right he was most always right he had an uncommon level head for aniggerI read considerable to Jim about kings and dukes and earls and such andhow gaudy they dressed and how much style they put on and called eachother your majesty and your grace and your lordship and so on steadof mister and Jims eyes bugged out and he was interested  He saysI didn know dey was so many un um  I haint hearn bout none un umskasely but ole King

business to talk like either one er theyuther of em  Is a Frenchman a manYesWell den  Dad blame it why doan he talk like a man  You answerme datI see it warnt no use wasting wordsyou cant learn a nigger to argueSo I quitCHAPTER XVWE judged that three nights more would fetch us to Cairo at the bottomof Illinois where the Ohio River comes in and that was what we wasafter  We would sell the raft and get on a steamboat and go way up theOhio amongst the free States and then be out of troubleWell the second night a fog begun to come on and we made for a towheadto tie to for it wouldnt do to try to run in a fog but when I paddledahead in the canoe with the line to make fast there warnt anythingbut little saplings to tie to  I passed the line around one of themright on the edge of the cut bank but there was a stiff current andthe raft come booming down so lively she tore it out by the roots andaway she went  I see the fog closing down and it made me so sick andscared I couldnt budge for most a half a minute it seemed to meandthen there warnt no raft in sight you couldnt see twenty yards  Ijumped into the canoe and run back to the stern and grabbed the paddleand set her back a stroke  But she didnt come  I was in such a hurryI hadnt untied her  I got up and tried to untie her but I was soexcited my hands shook so I couldnt hardly do anything with themAs soon as I got started I took out after the raft hot and heavy rightdown the towhead  That was all right as far as it went but the towheadwarnt sixty yards long and the minute I flew by the foot of it I shotout into the solid white fog and hadnt no more idea which way I wasgoing than a dead manThinks I it wont do to paddle first I know Ill run into the bankor a towhead or something I got to set still and float and yet itsmighty fidgety business to have to hold your hands still at such a time I whooped and listened  Away down there somewheres I hears a smallwhoop and up comes my spirits  I went tearing after it listeningsharp to hear it again  The next time it come I see I warnt headingfor it but heading away to the right of it  And the next time I washeading away to the left of itand not gaining on it much either forI was flying around this way and that and tother but it was goingstraight ahead all the timeI did wish the fool would think to beat a tin pan and beat it all thetime but he never did and it was the still places between the whoopsthat was making the trouble for me  Well I fought along and directlyI hears the whoop behind me  I was tangled good now  That wassomebody elses whoop or else I was turned aroundI throwed the paddle down  I heard the whoop again it was behind meyet but in a different place it kept coming and kept changing itsplace and I kept answering till by and by it was in front of me againand I knowed the current had swung the canoes head downstream and Iwas all right if that was Jim and not some other raftsman hollering I couldnt tell nothing about voices in a fog for nothing dont looknatural nor sound natural in a fogThe whooping went on and in about a minute I come abooming down on acut bank with smoky ghosts of big trees on it and the current throwedme off to the left and shot by amongst a lot of snags that fairlyroared the currrent was tearing by them so swiftIn another second or two it was solid white and still again  I setperfectly still then listening to my heart thump and I reckon I didntdraw a breath while it thumped a hundredI just give up then  I knowed what the matter was  That cut bankwas an island and Jim had gone down tother side of it  It warnt notowhead that you could float by in ten minutes  It had the big timberof a regular island it might be five or six miles long and more thanhalf a mile wideI kept quiet with my ears cocked about fifteen minutes I reckon  Iwas floating along of course four or five miles an hour but you dontever think of that  No you feel like you are laying dead still onthe water and if a little glimpse of a snag slips by you dont think toyourself how fast youre going but you catch your breath and thinkmy how that snags tearing along  If you think it aint dismal andlonesome out in a fog that way by yourself in the night you try itonceyoull seeNext for about a half an hour I whoops now and then at last I hearsthe answer a long ways off and tries to follow it but I couldnt doit and directly I judged Id got into a nest of towheads for I hadlittle dim glimpses of them on both sides of mesometimes just a narrowchannel between and some that I couldnt see I knowed was there becauseId hear the wash of the current against the old dead brush and trashthat hung over the banks  Well I warnt long loosing the whoops downamongst the towheads and I only tried to chase them a little whileanyway because it was worse than chasing a Jackolantern  You neverknowed a sound dodge around so and swap places so quick and so muchI had to claw away from the bank pretty lively four or five times tokeep from knocking the islands out of the river and so I judged theraft must be butting into the bank every now and then or else it wouldget further ahead and clear out of hearingit was floating a littlefaster than what I wasWell I seemed to be in the open river again by and by but I couldnthear no sign of a whoop nowheres  I reckoned Jim had fetched up on asnag maybe and it was all up with him  I was good and tired so Ilaid down in the canoe and said I wouldnt bother no more  I didntwant to go to sleep of course but I was so sleepy I couldnt help itso I thought I would take jest one little catnapBut I reckon it was more than a catnap for when I waked up the starswas shining bright the fog was all gone and I was spinning down abig bend stern first  First I didnt know where I was I thought I wasdreaming and when things began to come back to me they seemed to comeup dim out of last weekIt was a monstrous big river here with the tallest and the thickestkind of timber on both banks just a solid wall as well as I could seeby the stars  I looked away downstream and seen a black speck on thewater I took after it but when I got to it it warnt nothing but acouple of sawlogs made fast together  Then I see another speck andchased that then another and this time I was right  It was the raftWhen I got to it Jim was setting there with his head down between hisknees asleep with his right arm hanging over the steeringoar  Theother oar was smashed off and the raft was littered up with leaves andbranches and dirt  So shed had a rough timeI made fast and laid down under Jims nose on the raft and began togap and stretch my fists out against Jim and saysHello Jim have I been asleep  Why didnt you stir me upGoodness gracious is dat you Huck  En you ain deadyou aindrowndedyous back agin  Its too good for true honey its too goodfor true Lemme look at you chile lemme feel o you  No you aindead yous back agin live en soun jis de same ole Huckde same oleHuck thanks to goodnessWhats

night till you went to sleep about ten minutes ago and I reckonI done the same  You couldnt a got drunk in that time so of courseyouve been dreamingDad fetch it how is I gwyne to dream all dat in ten minutesWell hang it all you did dream it because there didnt any of ithappenBut Huck its all jis as plain to me asIt dont make no difference how plain it is there aint nothing in itI know because Ive been here all the timeJim didnt say nothing for about five minutes but set there studyingover it  Then he saysWell den I reckn I did dream it Huck but dog my cats ef it aintde powerfullest dream I ever see  En I haint ever had no dream bfodats tired me like dis oneOh well thats all right because a dream does tire a body likeeverything sometimes  But this one was a staving dream tell me allabout it JimSo Jim went to work and told me the whole thing right through just asit happened only he painted it up considerable  Then he said he muststart in and terpret it because it was sent for a warning  He saidthe first towhead stood for a man that would try to do us some good butthe current was another man that would get us away from him  The whoopswas warnings that would come to us every now and then and if we didnttry hard to make out to understand them theyd just take us into badluck stead of keeping us out of it  The lot of towheads was troubleswe was going to get into with quarrelsome people and all kinds of meanfolks but if we minded our business and didnt talk back and aggravatethem we would pull through and get out of the fog and into the bigclear river which was the free States and wouldnt have no moretroubleIt had clouded up pretty dark just after I got on to the raft but itwas clearing up again nowOh well thats all interpreted well enough as far as it goes Jim Isays but what does these things stand forIt was the leaves and rubbish on the raft and the smashed oar  Youcould see them firstrate nowJim looked at the trash and then looked at me and back at the trashagain  He had got the dream fixed so strong in his head that hecouldnt seem to shake it loose and get the facts back into its placeagain right away  But when he did get the thing straightened around helooked at me steady without ever smiling and saysWhat do dey stan for  Ise gwyne to tell you  When I got all woreout wid work en wid de callin for you en went to sleep my heart wuzmos broke bekase you wuz los en I didn kyer no mo what becomeer me en de raf  En when I wake up en fine you back agin all safeen soun de tears come en I could a got down on my knees en kiss yofoot Is so thankful En all you wuz thinkin bout wuz how you couldmake a fool uv ole Jim wid a lie  Dat truck dah is trash en trashis what people is dat puts dirt on de head er dey frens en makes emashamedThen he got up slow and walked to the wigwam and went in there withoutsaying anything but that  But that was enough  It made me feel so meanI could almost kissed his foot to get him to take it backIt was fifteen minutes before I could work myself up to go and humblemyself to a nigger but I done it and I warnt ever sorry for itafterwards neither  I didnt do him no more mean tricks and Iwouldnt done that one if Id a knowed it would make him feel that wayCHAPTER XVIWE slept most all day and started out at night a little ways behind amonstrous long raft that was as long going by as a procession  She hadfour long sweeps at each end so we judged she carried as many as thirtymen likely  She had five big wigwams aboard wide apart and an opencamp fire in the middle and a tall flagpole at each end  There was apower of style about her  It amounted to something being a raftsmanon such a craft as thatWe went drifting down into a big bend and the night clouded up and gothot  The river was very wide and was walled with solid timber onboth sides you couldnt see a break in it hardly ever or a light  Wetalked about Cairo and wondered whether we would know it when we got toit  I said likely we wouldnt because I had heard say there warnt butabout a dozen houses there and if they didnt happen to have them litup how was we going to know we was passing a town  Jim said if the twobig rivers joined together there that would show  But I said maybewe might think we was passing the foot of an island and coming into thesame old river again That disturbed Jimand me too  So the questionwas what to do  I said paddle ashore the first time a light showedand tell them pap was behind coming along with a tradingscow andwas a green hand at the business and wanted to know how far it was toCairo  Jim thought it was a good idea so we took a smoke on it andwaitedThere warnt nothing to do now but to look out sharp for the town andnot pass it without seeing it  He said hed be mighty sure to see itbecause hed be a free man the minute he seen it but if he missed ithed be in a slave country again and no more show for freedom  Everylittle while he jumps up and saysDah she isBut it warnt  It was Jackolanterns or lightning bugs so he setdown again and went to watching same as before  Jim said it made himall over trembly and feverish to be so close to freedom  Well I cantell you it made me all over trembly and feverish too to hear himbecause I begun to get it through my head that he was most freeandwho was to blame for it  Why me  I couldnt get that out of myconscience no how nor no way It got to troubling me so I couldntrest I couldnt stay still in one place  It hadnt ever come home tome before what this thing was that I was doing  But now it did and itstayed with me and scorched me more and more  I tried to make out tomyself that I warnt to blame because I didnt run Jim off from hisrightful owner but it warnt no use conscience up and says everytime But you knowed he was running for his freedom and you could apaddled ashore and told somebody  That was soI couldnt get aroundthat noway  That was where it pinched  Conscience says to me Whathad poor Miss Watson done to you that you could see her nigger go offright under your eyes and never say one single word  What did that poorold woman do to you that you could treat her so mean  Why she tried tolearn you your book she tried to learn you your manners she tried tobe good to you every way she knowed how  Thats what she doneI got to feeling so mean and so miserable I most wished I was dead  Ifidgeted up and down the raft abusing myself to myself and Jim wasfidgeting up and down past me  We neither of us could keep still Every time he danced around and says Dahs Cairo it went through melike a shot and I thought if it was Cairo I reckoned I would die ofmiserablenessJim talked out loud all the time while I was talking to myself  He wassaying how the first thing he would do when he got to a free State hewould go to saving up money and never spend a single cent and when hegot enough he would buy his wife which was owned on a farm close towhere Miss Watson lived and then they would both work to buy thetwo children and if their master wouldnt sell them theyd get anAblitionist to go and steal themIt most froze me to hear such talk  He wouldnt ever dared to talk suchtalk in his life before  Just see what a difference it made in him theminute he judged he was about free  It was according to the old sayingGive a nigger an inch and hell take an ell  Thinks I this is whatcomes of my not thinking  Here was this nigger which I had as goodas helped to run away coming right out flatfooted and saying he wouldsteal his childrenchildren that belonged to a man I didnt even know aman that hadnt ever done me no harmI was sorry to hear Jim say that it was such a lowering of him  Myconscience got to stirring me up hotter than ever until at last I saysto it Let up on meit aint too late yetIll paddle ashore at thefirst light and tell  I felt easy and happy and light as a featherright off  All my troubles was gone  I went to looking out sharp for alight and sort of singing to myself  By and by one showed  Jim singsoutWes safe Huck wes safe  Jump up and crack yo heels  Dats degood ole Cairo at las I jis knows itI saysIll take the canoe and go and see Jim  It mightnt be you knowHe jumped and got the canoe

because Iknowed very well I had done wrong and I see it warnt no use for meto try to learn to do right a body that dont get started right whenhes little aint got no showwhen the pinch comes there aint nothingto back him up and keep him to his work and so he gets beat  Then Ithought a minute and says to myself hold on spose youd a done rightand give Jim up would you felt better than what you do now  No saysI Id feel badId feel just the same way I do now  Well then saysI whats the use you learning to do right when its troublesome to doright and aint no trouble to do wrong and the wages is just the same I was stuck  I couldnt answer that  So I reckoned I wouldnt botherno more about it but after this always do whichever come handiest atthe timeI went into the wigwam Jim warnt there  I looked all around hewarnt anywhere  I saysJimHere I is Huck  Is dey out o sight yit  Dont talk loudHe was in the river under the stern oar with just his nose out  I toldhim they were out of sight so he come aboard  He saysI was alistenin to all de talk en I slips into de river en was gwyneto shove for sho if dey come aboard  Den I was gwyne to swim to deraf agin when dey was gone  But lawsy how you did fool em Huck Dat wuz de smartes dodge  I tell you chile Ispec it save oleJimole Jim aint going to forgit you for dat honeyThen we talked about the money  It was a pretty good raisetwentydollars apiece  Jim said we could take deck passage on a steamboatnow and the money would last us as far as we wanted to go in the freeStates He said twenty mile more warnt far for the raft to go but hewished we was already thereTowards daybreak we tied up and Jim was mighty particular about hidingthe raft good  Then he worked all day fixing things in bundles andgetting all ready to quit raftingThat night about ten we hove in sight of the lights of a town away downin a lefthand bendI went off in the canoe to ask about it  Pretty soon I found a man outin the river with a skiff setting a trotline  I ranged up and saysMister is that town CairoCairo no  You must be a blame foolWhat town is it misterIf you want to know go and find out  If you stay here botherinaround me for about a half a minute longer youll get something youwont wantI paddled to the raft  Jim was awful disappointed but I said nevermind Cairo would be the next place I reckonedWe passed another town before daylight and I was going out again butit was high ground so I didnt go  No high ground about Cairo Jimsaid I had forgot it  We laid up for the day on a towhead tolerableclose to the lefthand bank  I begun to suspicion something  So didJim  I saysMaybe we went by Cairo in the fog that nightHe saysDoan les talk about it Huck  Po niggers cant have no luck  Iawluz spected dat rattlesnakeskin warnt done wid its workI wish Id never seen that snakeskin JimI do wish Id never laideyes on itIt aint yo fault Huck you didn know  Dont you blame yoselfbout itWhen it was daylight here was the clear Ohio water inshore sureenough and outside was the old regular Muddy  So it was all up withCairoWe talked it all over  It wouldnt do to take to the shore we couldnttake the raft up the stream of course  There warnt no way but to waitfor dark and start back in the canoe and take the chances  So we sleptall day amongst the cottonwood thicket so as to be fresh for the workand when we went back to the raft about dark the canoe was goneWe didnt say a word for a good while  There warnt anything tosay  We both knowed well enough it was some more work of therattlesnakeskin so what was the use to talk about it  It would onlylook like we was finding fault and that would be bound to fetch morebad luckand keep on fetching it too till we knowed enough to keepstillBy and by we talked about what we better do and found there warnt noway but just to go along down with the raft till we got a chance to buya canoe to go back in  We warnt going to borrow it when there warntanybody around the way pap would do for that might set people afterusSo we shoved out after dark on the raftAnybody that dont believe yet that its foolishness to handle asnakeskin after all that that snakeskin done for us will believe itnow if they read on and see what more it done for usThe place to buy canoes is off of rafts laying up at shore  But wedidnt see no rafts laying up so we went along during three hours andmore  Well the night got gray and ruther thick which is the nextmeanest thing to fog  You cant tell the shape of the river and youcant see no distance It got to be very late and still and then alongcomes a steamboat up the river  We lit the lantern and judged shewould see it  Upstream boats didnt generly come close to us theygo out and follow the bars and hunt for easy water under the reefs butnights like this they bull right up the channel against the whole riverWe could hear her pounding along but we didnt see her good till shewas close  She aimed right for us  Often they do that and try to seehow close they can come without touching sometimes the wheel bites offa sweep and then the pilot sticks his head out and laughs and thinkshes mighty smart  Well here she comes and we said she was going totry and shave us but she didnt seem to be sheering off a bit  Shewas a big one and she was coming in a hurry too looking like a blackcloud with rows of glowworms around it but all of a sudden she bulgedout big and scary with a long row of wideopen furnace doors shininglike redhot teeth and her monstrous bows and guards hanging rightover us  There was a yell at us and a jingling of bells to stop theengines a powwow of cussing and whistling of steamand as Jim wentoverboard on one side and I on the other she come smashing straightthrough the raftI divedand I aimed to find the bottom too for a thirtyfoot wheelhad got to go over me and I wanted it to have plenty of room  I couldalways stay under water a minute this time I reckon I stayed under aminute and a half  Then I bounced for the top in a hurry for I wasnearly busting  I popped out to my armpits and blowed the water out ofmy nose and puffed a bit  Of course there was a booming current andof course that boat started her engines again ten seconds after shestopped them for they never cared much for raftsmen so now she waschurning along up the river out of sight in the thick weather though Icould hear herI sung out for Jim about a dozen times but I didnt get any answerso I grabbed a plank that touched me while I was treading water andstruck out for shore shoving it ahead of me  But I made out to seethat the drift of the current was towards the lefthand shore whichmeant that I was in a crossing so I changed off and went that wayIt was one of these long slanting twomile crossings so I was a goodlong time in getting over  I made a safe landing and clumb up thebank I couldnt see but a little ways but I went poking along overrough ground for a quarter of a mile or more and then I run across abig oldfashioned double loghouse before I noticed it  I was going torush by and get away but a lot of dogs jumped out and went to howlingand barking at me and I knowed better than to move another pegCHAPTER XVIIIN about a minute somebody spoke out of a window without putting hishead out and saysBe done boys  Whos thereI saysIts meWhos meGeorge Jackson sirWhat do you wantI dont want nothing sir  I only want to go along by but the dogswont let meWhat are you prowling around here this time of night forheyI warnt prowling around sir I fell overboard off of the steamboatOh you did did you  Strike a light there somebody  What did

thought I could hear my heart The dogs were as still as the humans but they followed a little behindme When I got to the three log doorsteps I heard them unlocking andunbarring and unbolting  I put my hand on the door and pushed it alittle and a little more till somebody said There thats enoughputyour head in I done it but I judged they would take it offThe candle was on the floor and there they all was looking at me andme at them for about a quarter of a minute  Three big men with gunspointed at me which made me wince I tell you the oldest grayand about sixty the other two thirty or moreall of them fine andhandsomeand the sweetest old grayheaded lady and back of her twoyoung women which I couldnt see right well  The old gentleman saysThere I reckon its all right  Come inAs soon as I was in the old gentleman he locked the door and barred itand bolted it and told the young men to come in with their guns andthey all went in a big parlor that had a new rag carpet on the floorand got together in a corner that was out of the range of the frontwindowsthere warnt none on the side  They held the candle and took agood look at me and all said Why he aint a Shepherdsonno thereaint any Shepherdson about him  Then the old man said he hoped Iwouldnt mind being searched for arms because he didnt mean no harm byitit was only to make sure  So he didnt pry into my pockets but onlyfelt outside with his hands and said it was all right  He told me tomake myself easy and at home and tell all about myself but the oldlady saysWhy bless you Saul the poor things as wet as he can be and dontyou reckon it may be hes hungryTrue for you RachelI forgotSo the old lady saysBetsy this was a nigger woman you fly around and get him somethingto eat as quick as you can poor thing and one of you

there aint nothing better that ever Ivecome across yet  Buck and his ma and all of them smoked cob pipesexcept the nigger woman which was gone and the two young women  Theyall smoked and talked and I eat and talked  The young women hadquilts around them and their hair down their backs  They all asked mequestions and I told them how pap and me and all the family was livingon a little farm down at the bottom of Arkansaw and my sister Mary Annrun off and got married and never was heard of no more and Bill wentto hunt them and he warnt heard of no more and Tom and Mort diedand then there warnt nobody but just me and pap left and he was justtrimmed down to nothing on account of his troubles so when he diedI took what there was left because the farm didnt belong to us andstarted up the river deck passage and fell overboard and that was howI come to be here  So they said I could have a home there as long as Iwanted it  Then it was most daylight and everybody went to bed and Iwent to bed with Buck and when I waked up in the morning drat it allI had forgot what my name was So I laid there about an hour trying tothink and when Buck waked up I saysCan you spell BuckYes he saysI bet you cant spell my name says II bet you what you dare I can says heAll right says I go aheadGeorge Jaxonthere now he saysWell says I you done it but I didnt think you could  It aint noslouch of a name to spellright off without studyingI set it down private because somebody might want me to spell itnext and so I wanted to be handy with it and rattle it off like I wasused to itIt was a mighty nice family and a mighty nice house too  I hadntseen no house out in the country before that was so nice and had so muchstyle  It didnt have an iron latch on the front door nor a wooden onewith a buckskin string but a brass knob to turn the same as houses intown There warnt no bed in the parlor nor a sign of a bed but heapsof parlors in towns has beds in them  There was a big fireplace thatwas bricked on the bottom and the bricks was kept clean and red bypouring water on them and scrubbing them with another brick sometimesthey wash them over with red waterpaint that they call Spanishbrownsame as they do in town  They had big brass dogirons that could holdup a sawlog There was a clock on the middle of the mantelpiece witha picture of a town painted on the bottom half of the glass front anda round place in the middle of it for the sun and you could see thependulum swinging behind it  It was beautiful to hear that clock tickand sometimes when one of these peddlers had been along and scoured herup and got her in good shape she would start in and strike a hundredand fifty before she got tuckered out  They wouldnt took any money forherWell there was a big outlandish parrot on each side of the clockmade out of something like chalk and painted up gaudy  By one of theparrots was a cat made of crockery and a crockery dog by the otherand when you pressed down on them they squeaked but didnt opentheir mouths nor look different nor interested  They squeaked throughunderneath  There was a couple of big wildturkeywing fans spread outbehind those things  On the table in the middle of the room was a kindof a lovely crockery basket that had apples and oranges and peaches andgrapes piled up in it which was much redder and yellower and prettierthan real ones is but they warnt real because you could see wherepieces had got chipped off and showed the white chalk or whatever itwas underneathThis table had a cover made out of beautiful oilcloth with a red andblue spreadeagle painted on it and a painted border all around  Itcome all the way from Philadelphia they said  There was some bookstoo piled up perfectly exact on each corner of the table  One was abig family Bible full of pictures  One was Pilgrims Progress about aman that left his family it didnt say why  I read considerable in itnow and then  The statements was interesting but tough  Another wasFriendships Offering full of beautiful stuff and poetry but I didntread the poetry  Another was Henry Clays Speeches and another was DrGunns Family Medicine which told you all about what to do if a bodywas sick or dead  There was a hymn book and a lot of other books  Andthere was nice splitbottom chairs and perfectly sound toonot baggeddown in the middle and busted like an old basketThey had pictures hung on the wallsmainly Washingtons and Lafayettesand battles and Highland Marys and one called Signing theDeclaration There was some that they called crayons which one of thedaughters which was dead made her own self when she was onlyfifteen years old  They was different from any pictures I ever seebeforeblacker mostly than is common  One was a woman in a slim blackdress belted small under the armpits with bulges like a cabbage inthe middle of the sleeves and a large black scoopshovel bonnet witha black veil and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape andvery wee black slippers like a chisel and she was leaning pensive on atombstone on her right elbow under a weeping willow and her other handhanging down her side holding a white handkerchief and a reticuleand underneath the picture it said Shall I Never See Thee More Alas Another one was a young lady with her hair all combed up straightto the top of her head and knotted there in front of a comb like achairback and she was crying into a handkerchief and had a dead birdlaying on its back in her other hand with its heels up and underneaththe picture it said I Shall Never Hear Thy Sweet Chirrup More Alas There was one where a young lady was at a window looking up at themoon and tears running down her cheeks and she had an open letter inone hand with black sealing wax showing on one edge of it and she wasmashing a locket with a chain to it against her mouth and underneaththe picture it said And Art Thou Gone Yes Thou Art Gone Alas  Thesewas all nice pictures I reckon but I didnt somehow seem to taketo them because if ever I was down a little they always give me thefantods  Everybody was sorry she died because she had laid out a lotmore of these pictures to do and a body could see by what she had donewhat they had lost  But I reckoned that with her disposition she washaving a better time in the graveyard  She was at work on what theysaid was her greatest picture when she took sick and every day andevery night it was her prayer to be allowed to live till she got itdone but she never got the chance  It was a picture of a young womanin a long white gown standing on the rail of a bridge all ready to jumpoff with her hair all down her back and looking up to the moon withthe tears running down her face and she had two arms folded across herbreast and two arms stretched out in front and two more reaching uptowards the moonand the idea was to see which pair would look bestand then scratch out all the other arms but as I was saying she diedbefore she got her mind made up and now they kept this picture over thehead of the bed in her room and every time her birthday come they hungflowers on it  Other times it was hid with a little curtain  The youngwoman in the picture had a kind of a nice sweet face but there was somany arms it made her look too spidery seemed to meThis young girl kept a scrapbook when she was alive and used to pasteobituaries and accidents and cases of patient suffering in it out of thePresbyterian Observer and write poetry after them out of her own headIt was very good poetry This is what she wrote about a boy by the nameof Stephen Dowling Bots that fell down a well and was drowndedODE TO STEPHEN DOWLING BOTS DECDAnd did young Stephen sicken    And did young Stephen die And did thesad hearts thicken    And did the mourners cryNo such was not the fate of    Young Stephen Dowling Bots Though sadhearts round him thickened    Twas not from sickness shotsNo whoopingcough did rack his frame    Nor measles drear with spotsNot these impaired the sacred name    Of Stephen Dowling BotsDespised love struck not with woe    That head of curly knots Norstomach troubles laid him low    Young Stephen Dowling BotsO no Then list with tearful eye    Whilst I his fate do tell His souldid from this cold world fly    By falling down a wellThey got him out and emptied him    Alas it was too late His spiritwas gone for to sport aloft    In the realms of the good and greatIf Emmeline Grangerford could make poetry like that before she wasfourteen there aint no telling what she could a done by and by  Bucksaid she could rattle off poetry like nothing  She didnt ever have tostop to think  He said she would slap down a line and if she couldntfind anything to rhyme with it would just scratch it out and slap downanother one and go ahead She warnt particular she could write aboutanything you choose to give her to write about just so it was sadfulEvery time a man died or a woman died or a child died she would be onhand with her tribute before he was cold  She called them tributesThe neighbors said it was the doctor first then Emmeline then theundertakerthe undertaker never got in ahead of Emmeline but once andthen she hung fire on a rhyme for the dead persons name which wasWhistler  She warnt ever the same after that she never complainedbut she kinder pined away and did not live long  Poor thing manys thetime I made myself go up to the little room that used to be hers and getout her poor old scrapbook and read in it when her pictures had beenaggravating me and I had soured on her a little  I liked all thatfamily dead ones and all and warnt going to let anything come betweenus  Poor Emmeline made poetry about all the dead people when she wasalive and it didnt seem right that there warnt nobody to make someabout her now she was gone so I tried to sweat out a verse or twomyself but I couldnt seem to make it go somehow  They kept Emmelinesroom trim and nice and all the things fixed in it just the way sheliked to have them when she was alive and nobody ever slept there The old lady took care of the room herself though there was plentyof niggers and she sewed there a good deal and read her Bible theremostlyWell as I was saying about the parlor there was beautiful curtains onthe windows  white with pictures painted on them of castles with vinesall down the walls and cattle coming down to drink  There was a littleold piano too that had tin pans in it I reckon and nothing was everso lovely as to hear the young ladies sing The Last Link is Brokenand play The Battle of Prague on it  The walls of all the rooms wasplastered and most had carpets on the floors and the whole house waswhitewashed on the outsideIt was a double house and the big open place betwixt them was roofedand floored and sometimes the table was set there in the middle of theday and it was a cool comfortable place  Nothing couldnt be better And warnt the cooking good and just bushels of it tooCHAPTER XVIIICOL  Grangerford was a gentleman you see  He was a gentleman allover and so was his family  He was well born as the saying is andthats worth as much in a man as it is in a horse so the Widow Douglassaid and nobody ever denied that she was of the first aristocracyin our town and pap he always said it too though he warnt no morequality than a mudcat himself  Col  Grangerford was very tall andvery slim and had a darkishpaly complexion not a sign of red in itanywheres he was clean shaved every morning all over his thin face andhe had the thinnest kind of lips and the thinnest kind of nostrils anda high nose and heavy eyebrows and the blackest kind of eyes sunk sodeep back that they seemed like they was looking out of caverns atyou as you may say  His forehead was high and his hair was black andstraight and hung to his shoulders His hands was long and thin andevery day of his life he put on a clean shirt and a full suit from headto foot made out of linen so white it hurt your eyes to look at itand on Sundays he wore a blue tailcoat with brass buttons on it  Hecarried a mahogany cane with a silver head to it  There warnt nofrivolishness about him not a bit and he warnt ever loud  He wasas kind as he could beyou could feel that you know and so you hadconfidence  Sometimes he smiled and it was good to see but when hestraightened himself up like a libertypole and the lightning begun toflicker out from under his eyebrows you wanted to climb a tree firstand find out what the matter was afterwards  He didnt ever have totell anybody to mind their mannerseverybody was always goodmanneredwhere he was  Everybody loved to have him around too he was sunshinemost alwaysI mean he made it seem like good weather  When he turnedinto a cloudbank it was awful dark for half a minute and that wasenough there wouldnt nothing go wrong again for a weekWhen him and the old lady come down in the morning all the family gotup out of their chairs and give them goodday and didnt set down againtill they had set down  Then Tom and Bob went to the sideboard wherethe decanter was and mixed a glass of bitters and handed it to him andhe held it in his hand and waited till Toms and Bobs was mixed andthen they bowed and said Our duty to you sir and madam and theybowed the least bit in the world and said thank you and so they drankall three and Bob and Tom poured a spoonful of water on the sugar andthe mite of whisky or apple brandy in the bottom of their tumblers andgive it to me and Buck and we drank to the old people tooBob was the oldest and Tom nexttall beautiful men with very broadshoulders and brown faces and long black hair and black eyes  Theydressed in white linen from head to foot like the old gentleman andwore broad Panama hatsThen there was Miss Charlotte she was twentyfive and tall and proudand grand but as good as she could be when she warnt stirred up butwhen she was she had a look that would make you wilt in your trackslike her father  She was beautifulSo was her sister Miss Sophia but it was a different kind  She wasgentle and sweet like a dove and she was only twentyEach person had their own nigger to wait on themBuck too  My niggerhad a monstrous easy time because I warnt used to having anybody doanything for me but Bucks was on the jump most of the timeThis was all there was of the family now but there used to bemorethree sons they got killed and Emmeline that diedThe old gentleman owned a lot of farms and over a hundred niggersSometimes a stack of people would come there horseback from ten orfifteen mile around and stay five or six days and have such junketingsround about and on the river and dances and picnics in the woodsdaytimes and balls at the house nights  These people was mostlykinfolks of the family  The men brought their guns with them  It was ahandsome lot of quality I tell youThere was another clan of aristocracy around therefive or sixfamiliesmostly of the name of Shepherdson  They was as hightonedand well born and rich and grand as the tribe of Grangerfords  TheShepherdsons and Grangerfords used the same steamboat landing which wasabout two mile above our house so sometimes when I went up there with alot of our folks I used to see a lot of the Shepherdsons there on theirfine horsesOne day Buck and me was away out in the woods hunting and heard a horsecoming  We was crossing the road  Buck saysQuick  Jump for the woodsWe done it and then peeped down the woods through the leaves  Prettysoon a splendid young man come galloping down the road setting hishorse easy and looking like a soldier  He had his gun across hispommel  I had seen him before  It was young Harney Shepherdson  Iheard Bucks gun go off at my ear and Harneys hat tumbled off from hishead  He grabbed his gun and rode straight to the place where we washid  But we didnt wait  We started through the woods on a run  Thewoods warnt thick so I looked over my shoulder to dodge the bulletand twice I seen Harney cover Buck with his gun and then he rode awaythe way he cometo get his hat I reckon but I couldnt see  We neverstopped running till we got home  The old gentlemans eyes blazed aminutetwas pleasure mainly I judgedthen his face sort of smootheddown and he says kind of gentleI dont like that shooting from behind a bush  Why didnt you stepinto the road my boyThe Shepherdsons dont father  They always take advantageMiss Charlotte she held her head up like a queen while Buck was tellinghis tale and her nostrils spread and her eyes snapped  The two youngmen looked dark but never said nothing  Miss Sophia she turned palebut the color come back when she found the man warnt hurtSoon as I could get Buck down by the corncribs under the trees byourselves I saysDid you want to kill him BuckWell I bet I didWhat did he do to youHim  He never done nothing to meWell then what did you want to kill him forWhy nothingonly its on account of the feudWhats a feudWhy where was you raised  Dont you know what a feud isNever heard of it beforetell me about itWell says Buck a feud is this way  A man has a quarrel withanother man and kills him then that other mans brother kills himthen the other brothers on both sides goes for one another then thecousins chip inand by and by everybodys killed off and there aintno more feud  But its kind of slow and takes a long timeHas this one been going on long BuckWell I should reckon  It started thirty year ago or somers alongthere  There was trouble bout something and then a lawsuit to settleit and the suit went agin one of the men and so he up and shot theman that won the suitwhich he would naturally do of course  AnybodywouldWhat was the trouble about BucklandI reckon maybeI dont knowWell who done the shooting  Was it a Grangerford or a ShepherdsonLaws how do I know  It was so long agoDont anybody knowOh yes pa knows I reckon and some of the other old people but theydont know now what the row was about in the first placeHas there been many killed BuckYes right smart chance of funerals  But they dont always kill  Pasgot a few buckshot in him but he dont mind it cuz he dont weighmuch anyway  Bobs been carved up some with a bowie and Toms beenhurt once or twiceHas anybody been killed this year BuckYes we got one and they got one  Bout three months ago my cousinBud fourteen year old was riding through the woods on tother sideof the river and didnt have no weapon with him which was blamefoolishness and in a lonesome place he hears a horse acoming behindhim and sees old Baldy Shepherdson alinkin after him with his gun inhis hand and his white hair aflying in the wind and stead of jumpingoff and taking to the brush Bud lowed he could outrun him so theyhad it nip and tuck for five mile or more the old man againing allthe time so at last Bud seen it warnt any use so he stopped and facedaround so as to have the bullet holes in front you know and the oldman he rode up and shot him down  But he didnt git much chance toenjoy his luck for inside of a week our folks laid him outI reckon that old man was a coward BuckI reckon he warnt a coward  Not by a blame sight  There aint acoward amongst them Shepherdsonsnot a one  And there aint no cowardsamongst the Grangerfords either  Why that old man kep up his end in afight one day for half an hour against three Grangerfords and comeout winner  They was all ahorseback he lit off of his horse and gotbehind a little woodpile and kep his horse before him to stop thebullets but the Grangerfords stayed on their horses and capered aroundthe old man and peppered away at him and he peppered away at them Him and his horse both went home pretty leaky and crippled but theGrangerfords had to be fetched homeand one of em was dead andanother died the next day  No sir if a bodys out hunting for cowardshe dont want to fool away any time amongst them Shepherdsons becuzthey dont breed any of that kindNext Sunday we all went to church about three mile everybodyahorseback The men took their guns along so did Buck and keptthem between their knees or stood them handy against the wall  TheShepherdsons done the same  It was pretty ornery preachingall aboutbrotherly love and suchlike tiresomeness but everybody said it wasa good sermon and they all talked it over going home and had sucha powerful lot to say about faith and good works and free grace andpreforeordestination and I dont know what all that it did seem to meto be one of the roughest Sundays I had run across yetAbout an hour after dinner everybody was dozing around some in theirchairs and some in their rooms and it got to be pretty dull  Buck anda dog was stretched out on the grass in the sun sound asleep  I went upto our room and judged I would take a nap myself  I found that sweetMiss Sophia standing in her door which was next to ours and she tookme in her room and shut the door very soft and asked me if I liked herand I said I did and she asked me if I would do something for her andnot tell anybody and I said I would  Then she said shed forgot herTestament and left it in the seat at church between two other booksand would I slip out quiet and go there and fetch it to her and not saynothing to nobody  I said I would So I slid out and slipped off up theroad and there warnt anybody at the church except maybe a hog or twofor there warnt any lock on the door and hogs likes a puncheon floorin summertime because its cool  If you notice most folks dont go tochurch only when theyve got to but a hog is differentSays I to myself somethings up it aint natural for a girl to be insuch a sweat about a Testament  So I give it a shake and out drops alittle piece of paper with HALFPAST TWO wrote on it with a pencil  Iransacked it but couldnt find anything else  I couldnt make anythingout of that so I put the paper in the book again and when I got homeand upstairs there was Miss Sophia in her door waiting for me  Shepulled me in and shut the door then she looked in the Testament tillshe found the paper and as soon as she read it she looked glad andbefore a body could think she grabbed me and give me a squeeze andsaid I was the best boy in the world and not to tell anybody  She wasmighty red in the face for a minute and her eyes lighted up and itmade her powerful pretty  I was a good deal astonished but when I gotmy breath I asked her what the paper was about and she asked me if Ihad read it and I said no and she asked me if I could read writingand I told her no only coarsehand and then she said the paperwarnt anything but a bookmark to keep her place and I might go andplay nowI went off down to the river studying over this thing and pretty soonI noticed that my nigger was following along behind  When we was outof sight of the house he looked back and around a second and then comesarunning and saysMars Jawge if youll come down into de swamp Ill show you a wholestack o watermoccasinsThinks I thats mighty curious he said that yesterday  He oughterknow a body dont love watermoccasins enough to go around hunting forthem What is he up to anyway  So I saysAll right trot aheadI followed a half a mile then he struck out over the swamp and wadedankle deep as much as another halfmile  We come to a little flat pieceof land which was dry and very thick with trees and bushes and vinesand he saysYou shove right in dah jist a few steps Mars Jawge dahs whah dey isIs seed m befo I dont kyer to see em no moThen he slopped right along and went away and pretty soon the trees hidhim  I poked into the place aways and come to a little open patchas big as a bedroom all hung around with vines and found a man layingthere asleepand by jings it was my old JimI waked him up and I reckoned it was going to be a grand surprise tohim to see me again but it warnt  He nearly cried he was so glad buthe warnt

reckn en youbet you hell fetch one ef he gits a chanstI took up the river road as hard as I could put  By and by I begin tohear guns a good ways off  When I come in sight of the log store andthe woodpile where the steamboats lands I worked along under the treesand brush till I got to a good place and then I clumb up into theforks of a cottonwood that was out of reach and watched  There was awoodrank four foot high a little ways in front of the tree and first Iwas going to hide behind that but maybe it was luckier I didntThere was four or five men cavorting around on their horses in the openplace before the log store cussing and yelling and trying to get ata couple of young chaps that was behind the woodrank alongside of thesteamboat landing but they couldnt come it  Every time one of themshowed himself on the river side of the woodpile he got shot at  Thetwo boys was squatting back to back behind the pile so they could watchboth waysBy and by the men stopped cavorting around and yelling  They startedriding towards the store then up gets one of the boys draws a steadybead over the woodrank and drops one of them out of his saddle  Allthe men jumped off of their horses and grabbed the hurt one and startedto carry him to the store and that minute the two boys started on therun  They got half way to the tree I was in before the men noticedThen the men see them and jumped on their horses and took out afterthem  They gained on the boys but it didnt do no good the boys hadtoo good a start they got to the woodpile that was in front of my treeand slipped in behind it and so they had the bulge on the men againOne of the boys was Buck and the other was a slim young chap aboutnineteen years oldThe men ripped around awhile and then rode away  As soon as they wasout of sight I sung out to Buck and told him  He didnt know whatto make of my voice coming out of the tree at first  He was awfulsurprised  He told me to watch out sharp and let him know when themen come in sight again said they was up to some devilment orotherwouldnt be gone long  I wished I was out of that tree but Idasnt come down  Buck begun to cry and rip and lowed that him andhis cousin Joe that was the other young chap would make up for thisday yet  He said his father and his two brothers was killed and twoor three of the enemy  Said the Shepherdsons laid for them inambush  Buck said his father and brothers ought to waited for theirrelationsthe Shepherdsons was too strong for them  I asked him whatwas become of young Harney and Miss Sophia  He said theyd got acrossthe river and was safe  I was glad of that but the way Buck did takeon because he didnt manage to kill Harney that day he shot at himIhaint ever heard anything like itAll of a sudden bang bang bang goes three or four gunsthe men hadslipped around through the woods and come in from behind without theirhorses  The boys jumped for the riverboth of them hurtand as theyswum down the current the men run along the bank shooting at them andsinging out Kill them kill them  It made me so sick I most fell outof the tree  I aint agoing to tell all that happenedit would makeme sick again if I was to do that  I wished I hadnt ever come ashorethat night to see such things  I aint ever going to get shut ofthemlots of times I dream about themI stayed in the tree till it begun to get dark afraid to come downSometimes I heard guns away off in the woods and twice I seen littlegangs of men gallop past the log store with guns so I reckoned thetrouble was still agoing on  I was mighty downhearted so I made up mymind I wouldnt ever go anear that house again because I reckoned Iwas to blame somehow I judged that that piece of paper meant that MissSophia was to meet Harney somewheres at halfpast two and run off andI judged I ought to told her father about that paper and the curious wayshe acted and then maybe he would a locked her up and this awful messwouldnt ever happenedWhen I got down out of the tree I crept along down the river bank apiece and found the two bodies laying in the edge of the water andtugged at them till I got them ashore then I covered up their facesand got away as quick as I could  I cried a little when I was coveringup Bucks face for he was mighty good to meIt was just dark now  I never went near the house but struck throughthe woods and made for the swamp  Jim warnt on his island so Itramped off in a hurry for the crick and crowded through the willowsredhot to jump aboard and get out of that awful country  The raft wasgone  My souls but I was scared  I couldnt get my breath for mosta minute Then I raised a yell  A voice not twentyfive foot from mesaysGood lan is dat you honey  Doan make no noiseIt was Jims voicenothing ever sounded so good before  I run along thebank a piece and got aboard and Jim he grabbed me and hugged me he wasso glad to see me  He saysLaws bless you chile I uz right down sho yous dead agin  Jacksbeen heah he say he reckn yous ben shot kase you didn come home nomo so Is jes dis minute a startin de raf down towards de mouf erde crick sos to be all ready for to shove out en leave soon as Jackcomes agin en tells me for certain you is dead  Lawsy Is mightyglad to git you back again honeyI saysAll rightthats mighty good they wont find me and theyll thinkIve been killed and floated down the rivertheres something up therethat ll help them think soso dont you lose no time Jim but justshove off for the big water as fast as ever you canI never felt easy till the raft was two mile below there and out inthe middle of the Mississippi  Then we hung up our signal lantern andjudged that we was free and safe once more  I hadnt had a bite to eatsince yesterday so Jim he got out some corndodgers and buttermilkand pork and cabbage and greensthere aint nothing in the world so goodwhen its cooked rightand whilst I eat my supper we talked and had agood time  I was powerful glad to get away from the feuds and so wasJim to get away from the swamp  We said there warnt no home like araft after all  Other places do seem so cramped up and smothery but araft dont  You feel mighty free and easy and comfortable on a raftCHAPTER XIXTWO or three days and nights went by I reckon I might say they swum bythey slid along so quiet and smooth and lovely  Here is the way we putin the time  It was a monstrous big river down theresometimes a mileand a half wide we run nights and laid up and hid daytimes soon asnight was most gone we stopped navigating and tied upnearly alwaysin the dead water under a towhead and then cut young cottonwoods andwillows and hid the raft with them  Then we set out the lines  Nextwe slid into the river and had a swim so as to freshen up and cooloff then we set down on the sandy bottom where the water was about kneedeep and watched the daylight come  Not a sound anywheresperfectlystilljust like the whole world was asleep only sometimes the bullfrogsacluttering maybe  The first thing to see looking away over thewater was a kind of dull linethat was the woods on tother side youcouldnt make nothing else out then a pale place in the sky then morepaleness spreading around then the river softened up away off andwarnt black any more but gray you could see little dark spotsdrifting along ever so far awaytrading scows and such things andlong black streaksrafts sometimes you could hear a sweep screaking orjumbled up voices it was so still and sounds come so far and by andby you could see a streak on the water which you know by the look of thestreak that theres a snag there in a swift current which breaks on itand makes that streak look that way and you see the mist curl up offof the water and the east reddens up and the river and you make out alogcabin in the edge of the woods away on the bank on tother side ofthe river being a woodyard likely and piled by them cheats so you canthrow a dog through it anywheres then the nice breeze springs up andcomes fanning you from over there so cool and fresh and sweet to smellon account of the woods and the flowers but sometimes not that waybecause theyve left dead fish laying around gars and such and theydo get pretty rank and next youve got the full day and everythingsmiling in the sun and the songbirds just going itA little smoke couldnt be noticed now so we would take some fish offof the lines and cook up a hot breakfast  And afterwards we would watchthe lonesomeness of the river and kind of lazy along and by and bylazy off to sleep  Wake up by and by and look to see what done it andmaybe see a steamboat coughing along upstream so far off towards theother side you couldnt tell nothing about her only whether she wasa sternwheel or sidewheel then for about an hour there wouldnt benothing to hear nor nothing to seejust solid lonesomeness  Nextyoud see a raft sliding by away off yonder and maybe a galoot on itchopping because theyre most always doing it on a raft youd see theaxe flash and come downyou dont hear nothing you see that axe goup again and by the time its above the mans head then you hear thekchunkit had took all that time to come over the water  So wewould put in the day lazying around listening to the stillness  Oncethere was a thick fog and the rafts and things that went by was beatingtin pans so the steamboats wouldnt run over them  A scow or araft went by so close we could hear them talking and cussing andlaughingheard them plain but we couldnt see no sign of them it madeyou feel crawly it was like spirits carrying on that way in the air Jim said he believed it was spirits but I saysNo spirits wouldnt say Dern the dern fogSoon as it was night out we shoved when we got her out to about themiddle we let her alone and let her float wherever the current wantedher to then we lit the pipes and dangled our legs in the water andtalked about all kinds of thingswe was always naked day and nightwhenever the mosquitoes would let usthe new clothes Bucks folks madefor me was too good to be comfortable and besides I didnt go much onclothes nohowSometimes wed have that whole river all to ourselves for the longesttime Yonder was the banks and the islands across the water and maybea sparkwhich was a candle in a cabin window and sometimes on the wateryou could see a spark or twoon a raft or a scow you know and maybeyou could hear a fiddle or a song coming over from one of them craftsIts lovely to live on a raft  We had the sky up there all speckledwith stars and we used to lay on our backs and look up at them anddiscuss about whether they was made or only just happened  Jim heallowed they was made but I allowed they happened I judged it wouldhave took too long to make so many  Jim said the moon could a laidthem well that looked kind of reasonable so I didnt say nothingagainst it because Ive seen a frog lay most as many so of course itcould be done We used to watch the stars that fell too and see themstreak down  Jim allowed theyd got spoiled and was hove out of thenestOnce or twice of a night we would see a steamboat slipping along in thedark and now and then she would belch a whole world of sparks up outof her chimbleys and they would rain down in the river and look awfulpretty then she would turn a corner and her lights would wink out andher powwow shut off and leave the river still again and by and by herwaves would get to us a long time after she was gone and joggle theraft a bit and after that you wouldnt hear nothing for you couldnttell how long except maybe frogs or somethingAfter midnight the people on shore went to bed and then for two orthree hours the shores was blackno more sparks in the cabin windows These sparks was our clockthe first one that showed again meantmorning was coming so we hunted a place to hide and tie up right awayOne morning about daybreak I found a canoe and crossed over a chute tothe main shoreit was only two hundred yardsand paddled about a mileup a crick amongst the cypress woods to see if I couldnt get someberries Just as I was passing a place where a kind of a cowpath crossedthe crick here comes a couple of men tearing up the path as tight asthey could foot it  I thought I was a goner for whenever anybody wasafter anybody I judged it was meor maybe Jim  I was about to dig outfrom there in a hurry but they was pretty close to me then and sungout and begged me to save their livessaid they hadnt been doingnothing and was being chased for itsaid there was men and dogsacoming  They wanted to jump right in but I saysDont you do it  I dont hear the dogs and horses yet youve got timeto crowd through the brush and get up the crick a little ways then youtake to the water and wade down to me and get inthatll throw the dogsoff the scentThey done it and soon as they was aboard I lit out for our towheadand in about five or ten minutes we heard the dogs and the men away offshouting We heard them come along towards the crick but couldntsee them they seemed to stop and fool around a while then as we gotfurther and further away all the time we couldnt hardly hear them atall by the time we had left a mile of woods behind us and struck theriver everything was quiet and we paddled over to the towhead and hidin the cottonwoods and was safeOne of these fellows was about seventy or upwards and had a bald headand very gray whiskers  He had an old batteredup slouch hat on anda greasy blue woollen shirt and ragged old blue jeans britches stuffedinto his boottops and homeknit gallusesno he only had one  He hadan old longtailed blue jeans coat with slick brass buttons flung

wanderin exiledtrampledon and sufferin rightful King of FranceWell he cried and took on so that me and Jim didnt know hardly what todo we was so sorryand so glad and proud wed got him with us too So we set in like we done before with the duke and tried to comforthim But he said it warnt no use nothing but to be dead and donewith it all could do him any good though he said it often made him feeleasier and better for a while if people treated him according to hisrights and got down on one knee to speak to him and always called himYour Majesty and waited on him first at meals and didnt set downin his presence till he asked them So Jim and me set to majestying himand doing this and that and tother for him and standing up till hetold us we might set down  This done him heaps of good and so hegot cheerful and comfortable  But the duke kind of soured on him anddidnt look a bit satisfied with the way things was going stillthe king acted real friendly towards him and said the dukesgreatgrandfather and all the other Dukes of Bilgewater was a gooddeal thought of by his father and was allowed to come to the palaceconsiderable but the duke stayed huffy a good while till by and by theking saysLike as not we got to be together a blamed long time on this hyerraft Bilgewater and so whats the use o your bein sour  It ll onlymake things oncomfortable  It aint my fault I warnt born a dukeit aint your fault you warnt born a kingso whats the use to worry Make the best o things the way you find em says Ithats my motto This aint no bad thing that weve struck hereplenty grub and an easylifecome give us your hand duke and les all be friendsThe duke done it and Jim and me was pretty glad to see it  It tookaway all the uncomfortableness and we felt mighty good over it becauseit would a been a miserable business to have any unfriendliness on theraft for what you want above all things on a raft is for everybodyto be satisfied and feel right and kind towards the othersIt didnt take me long to make up my mind that these liars warnt nokings nor dukes at all but just lowdown humbugs and frauds  But Inever said nothing never let on kept it to myself its the best waythen you dont have no quarrels and dont get into no trouble  If theywanted us to call them kings and dukes I hadnt no objections long asit would keep peace in the family and it warnt no use to tell Jim soI didnt tell him  If I never learnt nothing else out of pap I learntthat the best way to get along with his kind of people is to let themhave their own wayCHAPTER XXTHEY asked us considerable many questions wanted to know what wecovered up the raft that way for and laid by in the daytime instead ofrunningwas Jim a runaway nigger  Says IGoodness sakes would a runaway nigger run southNo they allowed he wouldnt  I had to account for things some way soI saysMy folks was living in Pike County in Missouri where I was born andthey all died off but me and pa and my brother Ike  Pa he lowedhed break up and go down and live with Uncle Ben whos got a littleonehorse place on the river fortyfour mile below Orleans  Pa waspretty poor and had some debts so when hed squared up there warntnothing left but sixteen dollars and our nigger Jim  That warntenough to take us fourteen hundred mile deck passage nor no other way Well when the river rose pa had a streak of luck one day he ketchedthis piece of a raft so we reckoned wed go down to Orleans on it Pas luck didnt hold out a steamboat run over the forrard corner ofthe raft one night and we all went overboard and dove under the wheelJim and me come up all right but pa was drunk and Ike was only fouryears old so they never come up no more  Well for the next day ortwo we had considerable trouble because people was always coming out inskiffs and trying to take Jim away from me saying they believed he wasa runaway nigger  We dont run daytimes no more now nights they dontbother usThe duke saysLeave me alone to cipher out a way so we can run in the daytime if wewant to  Ill think the thing overIll invent a plan thatll fix itWell let it alone for today because of course we dont want to go bythat town yonder in daylightit mightnt be healthyTowards night it begun to darken up and look like rain the heatlightning was squirting around low down in the sky and the leaves wasbeginning to shiverit was going to be pretty ugly it was easy to seethat  So the duke and the king went to overhauling our wigwam to seewhat the beds was like  My bed was a straw tick better than Jimswhich was a cornshuck tick theres always cobs around about in a shucktick and they poke into you and hurt and when you roll over the dryshucks sound like you was rolling over in a pile of dead leaves itmakes such a rustling that you wake up  Well the duke allowed he wouldtake my bed but the king allowed he wouldnt  He saysI should a reckoned the difference in rank would a sejested to you thata cornshuck bed warnt just fitten for me to sleep on  Your Grace lltake the shuck bed yourselfJim and me was in a sweat again for a minute being afraid there wasgoing to be some more trouble amongst them so we was pretty glad whenthe duke saysTis my fate to be always ground into the mire under the iron heel ofoppression  Misfortune has broken my once haughty spirit I yield Isubmit tis my fate  I am alone in the worldlet me suffer can bearitWe got away as soon as it was good and dark  The king told us to standwell out towards the middle of the river and not show a light till wegot a long ways below the town  We come in sight of the little bunch oflights by and bythat was the town you knowand slid by about a halfa mile out all right  When we was threequarters of a mile below wehoisted up our signal lantern and about ten oclock it come on to rainand blow and thunder and lighten like everything so the king told usto both stay on watch till the weather got better then him and the dukecrawled into the wigwam and turned in for the night  It was my watchbelow till twelve but I wouldnt a turned in anyway if Id had a bedbecause a body dont see such a storm as that every day in the week notby a long sight  My souls how the wind did scream along  And everysecond or two thered come a glare that lit up the whitecaps for a halfa mile around and youd see the islands looking dusty through the rainand the trees thrashing around in the wind then comes a HWHACKbumbum bumbleumbleumbumbumbumbumand the thunder would go rumblingand grumbling away and quitand then RIP comes another flash andanother sockdolager  The waves most washed me off the raft sometimesbut I hadnt any clothes on and didnt mind  We didnt have no troubleabout snags the lightning was glaring and flittering around so constantthat we could see them plenty soon enough to throw her head this way orthat and miss themI had the middle watch you know but I was pretty sleepy by that timeso Jim he said he would stand the first half of it for me he was alwaysmighty good that way Jim was  I crawled into the wigwam but the kingand the duke had their legs sprawled around so there warnt no show forme so I laid outsideI didnt mind the rain because it was warm andthe waves warnt running so high now  About two they come up againthough and Jim was going to call me but he changed his mind becausehe reckoned they warnt high enough yet to do any harm but he wasmistaken about that for pretty soon all of a sudden along comes aregular ripper and washed me overboard  It most killed Jim alaughing He was the easiest nigger to laugh that ever was anywayI took the watch and Jim he laid down and snored away and by and bythe storm let up for good and all and the first cabinlight that showedI rousted him out and we slid the raft into hiding quarters for thedayThe king got out an old ratty deck of cards after breakfast and himand the duke played sevenup a while five cents a game  Then they gottired of it and allowed they would lay out a campaign as they calledit The duke went down into his carpetbag and fetched up a lot oflittle printed bills and read them out loud  One bill said Thecelebrated Dr Armand de Montalban of Paris would lecture on theScience of Phrenology at such and such a place on the blank day ofblank at ten cents admission and furnish charts of character attwentyfive cents apiece  The duke said that was him  In anotherbill he was the worldrenowned Shakespearian tragedian Garrick theYounger of Drury Lane London  In other bills he had a lot of othernames and done other wonderful things like finding water and gold witha diviningrod dissipating witch spells and so on  By and by hesaysBut the histrionic muse is the darling  Have you ever trod the boardsRoyaltyNo says the kingYou shall then before youre three days older Fallen Grandeur saysthe duke  The first good town we come to well hire a hall and do thesword fight in Richard III and the balcony scene in Romeo and JulietHow does that strike youIm in up to the hub for anything that will pay Bilgewater but yousee I dont know nothing about playactin and haint ever seen muchof it  I was too small when pap used to have em at the palace  Do youreckon you can learn meEasyAll right  Im jist afreezn for something fresh anyway  Lescommence right awaySo the duke he told him all about who Romeo was and who Juliet was andsaid he was used to being Romeo so the king could be JulietBut if Juliets such a young gal duke my peeled head and my whitewhiskers is goin to look oncommon odd on her maybeNo dont you worry these country jakes wont ever think of thatBesides you know youll be in costume and that makes all thedifference in the world Juliets in a balcony enjoying the moonlightbefore she goes to bed and shes got on her nightgown and her rufflednightcap  Here are the costumes for the partsHe got out two or three curtaincalico suits which he said wasmeedyevil armor for Richard III and tother chap and a long whitecotton nightshirt and a ruffled nightcap to match  The king wassatisfied so the duke got out his book and read the parts over in themost splendid spreadeagle way prancing around and acting at the sametime to show how it had got to be done then he give the book to theking and told him to get his part by heartThere was a little onehorse town about three mile down the bend andafter dinner the duke said he had ciphered out his idea about how to runin daylight without it being dangersome for Jim so he allowed he wouldgo down to the town and fix that thing  The king allowed he would gotoo and see if he couldnt strike something  We was out of coffee soJim said I better go along with them in the canoe and get someWhen we got there there warnt nobody stirring streets empty andperfectly dead and still like Sunday  We found a sick nigger sunninghimself in a back yard and he said everybody that warnt too young ortoo sick or too old was gone to campmeeting about two mile back in thewoods  The king got the directions and allowed hed go and work thatcampmeeting for all it was worth and I might go tooThe duke said what he was after was a printingoffice  We found ita little bit of a concern up over a carpenter shopcarpenters andprinters all gone to the meeting and no doors locked  It was a dirtylitteredup place and had ink marks and handbills with pictures ofhorses and runaway niggers on them all over the walls  The duke shedhis coat and said he was all right now  So me and the king lit out forthe campmeetingWe got there in about a half an hour fairly dripping for it was a mostawful hot day  There was as much as a thousand people there fromtwenty mile around  The woods was full of teams and wagons hitchedeverywheres feeding out of the wagontroughs and stomping to keepoff the flies  There was sheds made out of poles and roofed over withbranches where they had lemonade and gingerbread to sell and piles ofwatermelons and green corn and suchlike truckThe preaching was going on under the same kinds of sheds only they wasbigger and held crowds of people  The benches was made out of outsideslabs of logs with holes bored in the round side to drive sticks intofor legs They didnt have no backs  The preachers had high platformsto stand on at one end of the sheds  The women had on sunbonnetsand some had linseywoolsey frocks some gingham ones and a few of theyoung ones had on calico  Some of the young men was barefooted andsome of the children didnt have on any clothes but just a towlinenshirt  Some of the old women was knitting and some of the young folkswas courting on the slyThe first shed we come to the preacher was lining out a hymn  He linedout two lines everybody sung it and it was kind of grand to hear itthere was so many of them and they done it in such a rousing way thenhe lined out two more for them to singand so on  The people woke upmore and more and sung louder and louder and towards the end somebegun to groan and some begun to shout  Then the preacher begun topreach and begun in earnest too and went weaving first to one side ofthe platform and then the other and then aleaning down over the frontof it with his arms and his body going all the time and shouting hiswords out with all his might and every now and then he would hold uphis Bible and spread it open and kind of pass it around this way andthat shouting Its the brazen serpent in the wilderness  Look uponit and live  And people would shout out GloryAamen  And sohe went on and the people groaning and crying and saying amenOh come to the mourners bench come black with sin Amen comesick and sore Amen come lame and halt and blind Amen comepore and needy sunk in shame AAMen come all thats worn andsoiled and sufferingcome with a broken spirit come with a contriteheart come in your rags and sin and dirt the waters that cleanseis free the door of heaven stands openoh enter in and be at restAAMen  Glory Glory HallelujahAnd so on  You couldnt make out what the preacher said any more onaccount of the shouting and crying  Folks got up everywheres in thecrowd and worked their way just by main strength to the mournersbench with the tears running down their faces and when all themourners had got up there to the front benches in a crowd they sung andshouted and flung themselves down on the straw just crazy and wildWell the first I knowed the king got agoing and you could hear himover everybody and next he went acharging up on to the platform andthe preacher he begged him to speak to the people and he done it  Hetold them he was a piratebeen a pirate for thirty years out in theIndian Oceanand his crew was thinned out considerable last spring ina fight and he was home now to take out some fresh men and thanks togoodness hed been robbed last night and put ashore off of a steamboatwithout a cent and he was glad of it it was the blessedest thing thatever happened to him because he was a changed man now and happy forthe first time in his life and poor as he was he was going to startright off and work his way back to the Indian Ocean and put in the restof his life trying to turn the pirates into the true path for he coulddo it better than anybody else being acquainted with all pirate crewsin that ocean and though it would take him a long time to get therewithout money he would get there anyway and every time he convinceda pirate he would say to him Dont you thank me dont you give me nocredit it all belongs to them dear people in Pokeville campmeetingnatural brothers and benefactors of the race and that dear preacherthere the truest friend a pirate ever hadAnd then he busted into tears and so did everybody  Then somebodysings out Take up a collection for him take up a collection  Wella half a dozen made a jump to do it but somebody sings out Let himpass the hat around  Then everybody said it the preacher tooSo the king went all through the crowd with his hat swabbing his eyesand blessing the people and praising them and thanking them for beingso good to the poor pirates away off there and every little while theprettiest kind of girls with the tears running down their cheeks wouldup and ask him would he let them kiss him for to remember him by and healways done it and some of them he hugged and kissed as many as five orsix timesand he was invited to stay a week and everybody wanted him tolive in their houses and said theyd think it was an honor but he saidas this was the last day of the campmeeting he couldnt do no good andbesides he was in a sweat to get to the Indian Ocean right off and go towork on the piratesWhen we got back to the raft and he come to count up he found he hadcollected eightyseven dollars and seventyfive cents  And then he hadfetched away a threegallon jug of whisky too that he found under awagon when he was starting home through the woods  The king saidtake it all around it laid over any day hed ever put in in themissionarying line  He said it warnt no use talking heathens dontamount to shucks alongside of pirates to work a campmeeting withThe duke was thinking hed been doing pretty well till the king cometo show up but after that he didnt think so so much  He had setup and printed off two little jobs for farmers in thatprintingofficehorse billsand took the money four dollars  And hehad got in ten dollars worth of advertisements for the paper which hesaid he would put in for four dollars if they would pay in advancesothey done it The price of the paper was two dollars a year but he tookin three subscriptions for half a dollar apiece on condition of thempaying him in advance they were going to pay in cordwood and onions asusual but he said he had just bought the concern and knocked down theprice as low as he could afford it and was going to run it for cash He set up a little piece of poetry which he made himself out ofhis own headthree verseskind of sweet and saddishthe name of it wasYes crush cold world this breaking heartand he left that all setup and ready to print in the paper and didnt charge nothing for it Well he took in nine dollars and a half and said hed done a prettysquare days work for itThen he showed us another little job hed printed and hadnt chargedfor because it was for us  It had a picture of a runaway nigger witha bundle on a stick over his shoulder and 200 reward under it  Thereading was all about Jim and just described him to a dot  It saidhe run away from St Jacques plantation forty mile below New Orleanslast winter and likely went north and whoever would catch him and sendhim back he could have the reward and expensesNow says the duke after tonight we can run in the daytime if wewant to  Whenever we see anybody coming we can tie Jim hand and footwith a rope and lay him in the wigwam and show this handbill and say wecaptured him up the river and were too poor to travel on a steamboatso we got this little raft on credit from our friends and are going downto get the reward  Handcuffs and chains would look still better on Jimbut it wouldnt go well with the story of us being so poor  Too muchlike jewelry  Ropes are the correct thingwe must preserve the unitiesas we say on the boardsWe all said the duke was pretty smart and there couldnt be no troubleabout running daytimes  We judged we could make miles enough that nightto get out of the reach of the powwow we reckoned the dukes work inthe printing office was going to make in that little town then we couldboom right along if we wanted toWe laid low and kept still and never shoved out till nearly tenoclock then we slid by pretty wide away from the town and didnthoist our lantern till we was clear out of sight of itWhen Jim called me to take the watch at four in the morning he saysHuck does you reckn we gwyne to run acrost any mo kings on distripNo I says I reckon notWell says he dats all right den  I doan mine one er two kingsbut dats enough  Dis ones powerful drunk en de duke ain muchbetterI found Jim had been trying to get him to talk French so he could hearwhat it was like but he said he had been in this country so long andhad so much trouble hed forgot itCHAPTER XXIIT was after sunup now but we went right on and didnt tie up  Theking and the duke turned out by and by looking pretty rusty but aftertheyd jumped overboard and took a swim it chippered them up a gooddeal After breakfast the king he took a seat on the corner of the raftand pulled off his boots and rolled up his britches and let his legsdangle in the water so as to be comfortable and lit his pipe and wentto getting his Romeo and Juliet by heart  When he had got it prettygood him and the duke begun to practice it together  The duke had tolearn him over and over again how to say every speech and he made himsigh and put his hand on his heart and after a while he said he doneit pretty well only he says you mustnt bellow out Romeothat way like a bullyou must say it soft and sick and languishysoRoomeo that is the idea for Juliets a dear sweet mere child ofa girl you know and she doesnt bray like a jackassWell next they got out a couple of long swords that the duke made outof oak laths and begun to practice the sword fightthe duke calledhimself Richard III and the way they laid on and pranced aroundthe raft was grand to see  But by and by the king tripped and felloverboard and after that they took a rest and had a talk about allkinds of adventures theyd had in other times along the riverAfter dinner the duke saysWell Capet well want to make this a firstclass show you know soI guess well add a little more to it  We want a little something toanswer encores with anywayWhats onkores BilgewaterThe duke told him and then saysIll answer by doing the Highland fling or the sailors hornpipe andyouwell let me seeoh Ive got ityou can do Hamlets soliloquyHamlets whichHamlets soliloquy you know the most celebrated thing in ShakespeareAh its sublime sublime  Always fetches the house  I havent gotit in the bookIve only got one volumebut I reckon I can piece it outfrom memory  Ill just walk up and down a minute and see if I can callit back from recollections vaultsSo he went to marching up and down thinking and frowning horribleevery now and then then he would hoist up his eyebrows next he wouldsqueeze his hand on his forehead and stagger back and kind of moan nexthe would sigh and next hed let on to drop a tear  It was beautifulto see him By and by he got it  He told us to give attention  Thenhe strikes a most noble attitude with one leg shoved forwards and hisarms stretched away up and his head tilted back looking up at the skyand then he begins to rip and rave and grit his teeth and after thatall through his speech he howled and spread around and swelled up hischest and just knocked the spots out of any acting ever I see before This is the speechI learned it easy enough while he was learning itto the kingTo be or not to be that is the bare bodkin That makes calamity ofso long life For who would fardels bear till Birnam Wood do cometo Dunsinane But that the fear of something after death Murders theinnocent sleep Great natures second course And makes us rather slingthe arrows of outrageous fortune Than fly to others that we know not ofTheres the respect must give us pause Wake Duncan with thy knocking Iwould thou couldst For who would bear the whips and scorns of time Theoppressors wrong the proud mans contumely The laws delay and thequietus which his pangs might take In the dead waste and middle of thenight when churchyards yawn In customary suits of solemn black Butthat the undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveler returnsBreathes forth contagion on the world And thus the native hue ofresolution like the poor cat i the adage Is sicklied oer with careAnd all the clouds that lowered oer our housetops With thisregard their currents turn awry And lose the name of action Tis aconsummation devoutly to be wished But soft you the fair Ophelia Openot thy ponderous and marble jaws But get thee to a nunnerymdashgoWell the old man he liked that speech and he mighty soon got it so hecould do it first rate It seemed like he was just born for it and whenhe had his hand in and was excited it was perfectly lovely the way hewould rip and tear and rair up behind when he was getting it offThe first chance we got the duke he had some show bills printed andafter that for two or three days as we floated along the raft was amost uncommon lively place for there warnt nothing but swordfightingand rehearsingas the duke called itgoing on all the time One morningwhen we was pretty well down the State of Arkansaw we come in sightof a little onehorse town in a big bend so we tied up aboutthreequarters of a mile above it in the mouth of a crick which wasshut in like a tunnel by the cypress trees and all of us but Jim tookthe canoe and went down there to see if there was any chance in thatplace for our showWe struck it mighty lucky there was going to be a circus there thatafternoon and the country people was already beginning to come in inall kinds of old shackly wagons and on horses The circus would leavebefore night so our show would have a pretty good chance The duke hehired the court house and we went around and stuck up our bills Theyread like thisShaksperean RevivalWonderful AttractionFor One Night Only The world renowned tragediansDavid Garrick the younger of Drury Lane

concerns that hadnt ever been painted theywas set up three or four foot above ground on stilts so as to be out ofreach of the water when the river was overflowed The houses had littlegardens around them but they didnt seem to raise hardly anything inthem but jimpson weeds and sunflowers and ashpiles and old curledupboots and shoes and pieces of bottles and rags and playedouttinware The fences was made of different kinds of boards nailed onat different times and they leaned every whichway and had gates thatdidnt generly have but one hingea leather one Some of the fenceshad been whitewashed some time or another but the duke said it was inClumbuss time like enough There was generly hogs in the garden andpeople driving them outAll the stores was along one street  They had white domestic awnings infront and the country people hitched their horses to the awningpostsThere was empty drygoods boxes under the awnings and loafers roostingon them all day long whittling them with their Barlow knives andchawing tobacco and gaping and yawning and stretchinga mighty ornerylot They generly had on yellow straw hats most as wide as an umbrellabut didnt wear no coats nor waistcoats they called one another Billand Buck and Hank and Joe and Andy and talked lazy and drawly andused considerable many cuss words  There was as many as one loaferleaning up against every awningpost and he most always had his handsin his britchespockets except when he fetched them out to lend a chawof tobacco or scratch  What a body was hearing amongst them all thetime wasGimme a chaw v tobacker HankCaint I haint got but one chaw left  Ask BillMaybe Bill he gives him a chaw maybe he lies and says he aint gotnone Some of them kinds of loafers never has a cent in the world nor achaw of tobacco of their own  They get all their chawing by borrowingthey say to a fellow I wisht youd len me a chaw Jack I jist thisminute give Ben Thompson the last chaw I hadwhich is a lie prettymuch everytime it dont fool nobody but a stranger but Jack aint nostranger so he saysYou give him a chaw did you  So did your sisters catsgrandmother You pay me back the chaws youve awready borryd offn meLafe Buckner then Ill loan you one or two ton of it and wont chargeyou no back intrust nutherWell I did pay you back some of it wunstYes you didbout six chaws  You borryd store tobacker and paid backniggerheadStore tobacco is flat black plug but these fellows mostly chaws thenatural leaf twisted  When they borrow a chaw they dont generly cut itoff with a knife but set the plug in between their teeth and gnaw withtheir teeth and tug at the plug with their hands till they get it intwo then sometimes the one that owns the tobacco looks mournful at itwhen its handed back and says sarcasticHere gimme the chaw and you take the plugAll the streets and lanes was just mud they warnt nothing else butmudmud as black as tar and nigh about a foot deep in some placesand two or three inches deep in all the places  The hogs loafed andgrunted around everywheres  Youd see a muddy sow and a litter of pigscome lazying along the street and whollop herself right down in the waywhere folks had to walk around her and shed stretch out and shut hereyes and wave her ears whilst the pigs was milking her and look ashappy as if she was on salary And pretty soon youd hear a loafersing out Hi  so boy sick him Tige and away the sow would gosquealing most horrible with a dog or two swinging to each ear andthree or four dozen more acoming and then you would see all theloafers get up and watch the thing out of sight and laugh at the funand look grateful for the noise  Then theyd settle back again tillthere was a dog fight  There couldnt anything wake them up all overand make them happy all over like a dog fightunless it might beputting turpentine on a stray dog and setting fire to him or tying atin pan to his tail and see him run himself to deathOn the river front some of the houses was sticking out over the bankand they was bowed and bent and about ready to tumble in The peoplehad moved out of them  The bank was caved away under one corner of someothers and that corner was hanging over  People lived in them yet butit was dangersome because sometimes a strip of land as wide as a housecaves in at a time  Sometimes a belt of land a quarter of a mile deepwill start in and cave along and cave along till it all caves into theriver in one summer Such a town as that has to be always moving backand back and back because the rivers always gnawing at itThe nearer it got to noon that day the thicker and thicker was thewagons and horses in the streets and more coming all the time Families fetched their dinners with them from the country and eat themin the wagons  There was considerable whisky drinking going on and Iseen three fights  By and by somebody sings outHere comes old Boggsin from the country for his little old monthlydrunk here he comes boysAll the loafers looked glad I reckoned they was used to having fun outof Boggs  One of them saysWonder who hes agwyne to chaw up this time  If hed achawed up allthe men hes ben agwyne to chaw up in the last twenty year hed haveconsiderable ruputation nowAnother one says I wisht old Boggs d threaten me cuz then Id knowI warnt gwyne to die for a thousan yearBoggs comes atearing along on his horse whooping and yelling like anInjun and singing outCler the track thar  Im on the wawpath and the price uv coffins isagwyne to raiseHe was drunk and weaving about in his saddle he was over fifty yearold and had a very red face  Everybody yelled at him and laughed athim and sassed him and he sassed back and said hed attend to them andlay them out in their regular turns but he couldnt wait now becausehed come to town to kill old Colonel Sherburn and his motto was Meatfirst and spoon vittles to top off onHe see me and rode up and saysWhard you come fm boy  You prepared to dieThen he rode on  I was scared but a man saysHe dont mean nothing hes always acarryin on like that when hesdrunk  Hes the best naturedest old fool in Arkansawnever hurt nobodydrunk nor soberBoggs rode up before the biggest store in town and bent his head downso he could see under the curtain of the awning and yellsCome out here Sherburn Come out and meet the man youve swindledYoure the houn Im after and Im agwyne to have you tooAnd so he went on calling Sherburn everything he could lay his tongueto and the whole street packed with people listening and laughing andgoing on  By and by a proudlooking man about fiftyfiveand he was aheap the best dressed man in that town toosteps out of the store andthe crowd drops back on each side to let him come  He says to Boggsmighty cam and slowhe saysIm tired of this but Ill endure it till one oclock  Till oneoclock mindno longer  If you open your mouth against me only onceafter that time you cant travel so far but I will find youThen he turns and goes in  The crowd looked mighty sober nobodystirred and there warnt no more laughing  Boggs rode offblackguarding Sherburn as loud as he could yell all down the streetand pretty soon back he comes and stops before the store still keepingit up  Some men crowded around him and tried to get him to shut upbut he wouldnt they told him it would be one oclock in about fifteenminutes and so he must go homehe must go right away  But it didntdo no good  He cussed away with all his might and throwed his hat downin the mud and rode over it and pretty soon away he went araging downthe street again with his gray hair aflying Everybody that could geta chance at him tried their best to coax him off of his horse so theycould lock him up and get him sober but it warnt no useup the streethe would tear again and give Sherburn another cussing  By and bysomebody saysGo for his daughterquick go for his daughter sometimes hell listento her  If anybody can persuade him she canSo somebody started on a run  I walked down street a ways and stoppedIn about five or ten minutes here comes Boggs again but not on hishorse  He was areeling across the street towards me bareheaded witha friend on both sides of him aholt of his arms and hurrying him alongHe was quiet and looked uneasy and he warnt hanging back any but wasdoing some of the hurrying himself  Somebody sings outBoggsI looked over there to see who said it and it was that ColonelSherburn He was standing perfectly still in the street and had apistol raised in his right handnot aiming it but holding it out withthe barrel tilted up towards the sky  The same second I see a younggirl coming on the run and two men with her  Boggs and the men turnedround to see who called him and when they see the pistol the menjumped to one side and the pistolbarrel come down slow and steady toa levelboth barrels cocked Boggs throws up both of his hands and saysO Lord dont shoot  Bang goes the first shot and he staggers backclawing at the airbang goes the second one and he tumbles backwardson to the ground heavy and solid with his arms spread out  That younggirl screamed out and comes rushing and down she throws herself on herfather crying and saying Oh hes killed him hes killed him  Thecrowd closed up around them and shouldered and jammed one another withtheir necks stretched trying to see and people on the inside trying toshove them back and shouting Back back give him air give him airColonel Sherburn he tossed his pistol on to the ground and turnedaround on his heels and walked offThey took Boggs to a little drug store the crowd pressing around justthe same and the whole town following and I rushed and got a goodplace at the window where I was close to him and could see in  Theylaid him on the floor and put one large Bible under his head and openedanother one and spread it on his breast but they tore open his shirtfirst and I seen where one of the bullets went in  He made about adozen long gasps his breast lifting the Bible up when he drawed in hisbreath and letting it down again when he breathed it outand after thathe laid still he was dead  Then they pulled his daughter away fromhim screaming and crying and took her off  She was about sixteen andvery sweet and gentle looking but awful pale and scaredWell pretty soon the whole town was there squirming and scrouging andpushing and shoving to get at the window and have a look but peoplethat had the places wouldnt give them up and folks behind them wassaying all the time Say now youve looked enough you fellowstaint right and taint fair for you to stay thar all the time andnever give nobody a chance other folks has their rights as well asyouThere was considerable jawing back so I slid out thinking maybethere was going to be trouble  The streets was full and everybody wasexcited Everybody that seen the shooting was telling how it happenedand there was a big crowd packed around each one of these fellowsstretching their necks and listening  One long lanky man with longhair and a big white fur stovepipe hat on the back of his head and acrookedhandled cane marked out the places on the ground where Boggsstood and where Sherburn stood and the people following him around fromone place to tother and watching everything he done and bobbing theirheads to show they understood and stooping a little and resting theirhands on their thighs to watch him mark the places on the ground withhis cane and then he stood up straight and stiff where Sherburn hadstood frowning and having his hatbrim down over his eyes and sungout Boggs and then fetched his cane down slow to a level and saysBang staggered backwards says Bang again and fell down flat onhis back The people that had seen the thing said he done it perfectsaid it was just exactly the way it all happened  Then as much as adozen people got out their bottles and treated himWell by and by somebody said Sherburn ought to be lynched  In about aminute everybody was saying it so away they went mad and yelling andsnatching down every clothesline they come to to do the hanging withCHAPTER XXIITHEY swarmed up towards Sherburns house awhooping and raging likeInjuns and everything had to clear the way or get run over and trompedto mush and it was awful to see  Children was heeling it ahead of themob screaming and trying to get out of the way and every window alongthe road was full of womens heads and there was nigger boys in everytree and bucks and wenches looking over every fence and as soon as themob would get nearly to them they would break and skaddle back out ofreach  Lots of the women and girls was crying and taking on scaredmost to deathThey swarmed up in front of Sherburns palings as thick as they couldjam together and you couldnt hear yourself think for the noise  Itwas a little twentyfoot yard  Some sung out Tear down the fence teardown the fence  Then there was a racket of ripping and tearing andsmashing and down she goes and the front wall of the crowd begins toroll in like a waveJust then Sherburn steps out on to the roof of his little front porchwith a doublebarrel gun in his hand and takes his stand perfectlycam and deliberate not saying a word  The racket stopped and thewave sucked backSherburn never said a wordjust stood there looking down  Thestillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable  Sherburn run his eye slowalong the crowd and wherever it struck the people tried a little tooutgaze him but they couldnt they dropped their eyes and lookedsneaky Then pretty soon Sherburn sort of laughed not the pleasantkind but the kind that makes you feel like when you are eating breadthats got sand in itThen he says slow and scornfulThe idea of you lynching anybody  Its amusing  The idea of youthinking you had pluck enough to lynch a man  Because youre braveenough to tar and feather poor friendless castout women that come alonghere did that make you think you had grit enough to lay your hands on aman  Why a mans safe in the hands of ten thousand of your kindaslong as its daytime and youre not behind himDo I know you  I know you clear through I was born and raised in theSouth and Ive lived in the North so I know the average all aroundThe average mans a coward  In the North he lets anybody walk over himthat wants to and goes home and prays for a humble spirit to bear itIn the South one man all by himself has stopped a stage full of menin the daytime and robbed the lot  Your newspapers call you abrave people so much that you think you are braver than any otherpeoplewhereas youre just as brave and no braver  Why dont yourjuries hang murderers  Because theyre afraid the mans friends willshoot them in the back in the darkand its just what they would doSo they always acquit and then a man goes in the night with ahundred masked cowards at his back and lynches the rascal  Your mistakeis that you didnt bring a man with you thats one mistake and theother is that you didnt come in the dark and fetch your masks  Youbrought part of a manBuck Harkness thereand if you hadnt had himto start you youd a taken it out in blowingYou didnt want to come  The average man dont like trouble anddanger You dont like trouble and danger  But if only half amanlike Buck Harkness thereshouts Lynch him lynch him youreafraid to back downafraid youll be found out to be what youarecowardsand so you raise a yell and hang yourselves on to thathalfamans coattail and come raging up here swearing what bigthings youre going to do The pitifulest thing out is a mob thatswhat an army isa mob they dont fight with courage thats born inthem but with courage thats borrowed from their mass and from theirofficers  But a mob without any man at the head of it is beneathpitifulness  Now the thing for you to do is to droop your tails andgo home and crawl in a hole  If any real lynchings going to be done itwill be done in the dark Southern fashion and when they come theyllbring their masks and fetch a man along  Now leaveand take yourhalfaman with youtossing his gun up across his left arm and cockingit when he says thisThe crowd washed back sudden and then broke all apart and went tearingoff every which way and Buck Harkness he heeled it after them lookingtolerable cheap  I could a stayed if I wanted to but I didnt want toI went to the circus and loafed around the back side till the watchmanwent by and then dived in under the tent  I had my twentydollar goldpiece and some other money but I reckoned I better save it becausethere aint no telling how soon you are going to need it away fromhome and amongst strangers that way  You cant be too careful  I aintopposed to spending money on circuses when there aint no other way butthere aint no use in wasting it on themIt was a real bully circus  It was the splendidest sight that ever waswhen they all come riding in two and two a gentleman and lady sideby side the men just in their drawers and undershirts and no shoesnor stirrups and resting their hands on their thighs easy andcomfortablethere must a been twenty of themand every lady with alovely complexion and perfectly beautiful and looking just like a gangof real sureenough queens and dressed in clothes that cost millions ofdollars and just littered with diamonds  It was a powerful fine sightI never see anything so lovely  And then one by one they got upand stood and went aweaving around the ring so gentle and wavy andgraceful the men looking ever so tall and airy and straight with theirheads bobbing and skimming along away up there under the tentroof andevery ladys roseleafy dress flapping soft and silky around her hipsand she looking like the most loveliest parasolAnd then faster and faster they went all of them dancing first onefoot out in the air and then the other the horses leaning more andmore and the ringmaster going round and round the centerpole crackinghis whip and shouting Hihi and the clown cracking jokes behindhim and by and by all hands dropped the reins and every lady put herknuckles on her hips and every gentleman folded his arms and then howthe horses did lean over and hump themselves  And so one after theother they all skipped off into the ring and made the sweetest bow Iever see and then scampered out and everybody clapped their hands andwent just about wildWell all through the circus they done the most astonishing things andall the time that clown carried on so it most killed the people  Theringmaster couldnt ever say a word to him but he was back at him quickas a wink with the funniest things a body ever said and how he evercould think of so many of them and so sudden and so pat was what Icouldnt noway understand Why I couldnt a thought of them in a yearAnd by and by a drunk man tried to get into the ringsaid he wanted toride said he could ride as well as anybody that ever was  They arguedand tried to keep him out but he wouldnt listen and the whole showcome to a standstill  Then the people begun to holler at him and makefun of him and that made him mad and he begun to rip and tear so thatstirred up the people and a lot of men begun to pile down off of thebenches and swarm towards the ring saying Knock him down throw himout and one or two women begun to scream  So then the ringmasterhe made a little speech and said he hoped there wouldnt be nodisturbance and if the man would promise he wouldnt make no moretrouble he would let him ride if he thought he could stay on the horse So everybody laughed and said all right and the man got on The minutehe was on the horse begun to rip and tear and jump and cavort aroundwith two circus men hanging on to his bridle trying to hold him and thedrunk man hanging on to his neck and his heels flying in the air everyjump and the whole crowd of people standing up shouting and laughingtill tears rolled down  And at last sure enough all the circus mencould do the horse broke loose and away he went like the very nationround and round the ring with that sot laying down on him and hangingto his neck with first one leg hanging most to the ground on one sideand then tother one on tother side and the people just crazy  Itwarnt funny to me though I was all of a tremble to see his danger But pretty soon he struggled up astraddle and grabbed the bridleareeling this way and that and the next minute he sprung up anddropped the bridle and stood and the horse agoing like a house afiretoo  He just stood up there asailing around as easy and comfortableas if he warnt ever drunk in his lifeand then he begun to pull off hisclothes and sling them  He shed them so thick they kind of clogged upthe air and altogether he shed seventeen suits And then there hewas slim and handsome and dressed the gaudiest and prettiest youever saw and he lit into that horse with his whip and made him fairlyhumand finally skipped off and made his bow and danced off tothe dressingroom and everybody just ahowling with pleasure andastonishmentThen the ringmaster he see how he had been fooled and he was thesickest ringmaster you ever see I reckon  Why it was one of his ownmen  He had got up that joke all out of his own head and never let onto nobody Well I felt sheepish enough to be took in so but I wouldnta been in that ringmasters place not for a thousand dollars  I dontknow there may be bullier circuses than what that one was but Inever struck them yet Anyways it was plenty good enough for me andwherever I run across it it can have all of my custom every timeWell that night we had our show but there warnt only about twelvepeople therejust enough to pay expenses  And they laughed all thetime and that made the duke mad and everybody left anyway beforethe show was over but one boy which was asleep  So the duke said theseArkansaw lunkheads couldnt come up to Shakespeare what they wantedwas low comedyand maybe something ruther worse than low comedy hereckoned  He said he could size their style  So next morning he gotsome big sheets of wrapping paper and some black paint and drawed offsome handbills and stuck them up all over the village  The bills saidCHAPTER XXIIIWELL all day him and the king was hard at it rigging up a stage anda curtain and a row of candles for footlights and that night the housewas jam full of men in no time  When the place couldnt hold no morethe duke he quit tending door and went around the back way and come onto the stage and stood up before the curtain and made a little speechand praised up this tragedy and said it was the most thrillingest onethat ever was and so he went on abragging about the tragedy and aboutEdmund Kean the Elder which was to play the main principal part in itand at last when hed got everybodys expectations up high enough herolled up the curtain and the next minute the king come aprancingout on all fours naked and he was painted all overringstreakedandstriped all sorts of colors as splendid as arainbow  Andbut never mind the rest of his outfit it was just wildbut it was awful funny The people most killed themselves laughing andwhen the king got done capering and capered off behind the scenes theyroared and clapped and stormed and hawhawed till he come back and doneit over again and after that they made him do it another time Well itwould make a cow laugh to see the shines that old idiot cutThen the duke he lets the curtain down and bows to the people and saysthe great tragedy will be performed only two nights more on accounts ofpressing London engagements where the seats is all sold already for itin Drury Lane and then he makes them another bow and says if he hassucceeded in pleasing them and instructing them he will be deeplyobleeged if they will mention it to their friends and get them to comeand see itTwenty people sings outWhat is it over  Is that allThe duke says yes  Then there was a fine time  Everybody singsout Sold and rose up mad and was agoing for that stage and themtragedians  But a big fine looking man jumps up on a bench and shoutsHold on  Just a word gentlemen  They stopped to listen  We aresoldmighty badly sold  But we dont want to be the laughing stock ofthis whole town I reckon and never hear the last of this thing as longas we live  No  What we want is to go out of here quiet and talkthis show up and sell the rest of the town  Then well all be in thesame boat  Aint that sensible You bet it isthe jedge is righteverybody sings out All right thennot a word about any sell  Goalong home and advise everybody to come and see the tragedyNext day you couldnt hear nothing around that town but how splendidthat show was  House was jammed again that night and we sold thiscrowd the same way  When me and the king and the duke got home to theraft we all had a supper and by and by about midnight they made Jimand me back her out and float her down the middle of the river andfetch her in and hide her about two mile below townThe third night the house was crammed againand they warnt newcomersthis time but people that was at the show the other two nights  Istood by the duke at the door and I see that every man that went in hadhis pockets bulging or something muffled up under his coatand I see itwarnt no perfumery neither not by a long sight  I smelt sickly eggsby the barrel and rotten cabbages and such things and if I know thesigns of a dead cat being around and I bet I do there was sixtyfourof them went in  I shoved in there for a minute but it was too variousfor me I couldnt stand it  Well when the place couldnt hold no morepeople the duke he give a fellow a quarter and told him to tend doorfor him a minute and then he started around for the stage door I afterhim but the minute we turned the corner and was in the dark he saysWalk fast now till you get away from the houses and then shin for theraft like the dickens was after youI done it and he done the same  We struck the raft at the same timeand in less than two seconds we was gliding down stream all dark andstill and edging towards the middle of the river nobody saying aword I reckoned the poor king was in for a gaudy time of it with theaudience but nothing of the sort pretty soon he crawls out from underthe wigwam and saysWell howd the old thing pan out this time duke  He hadnt beenuptown at allWe never showed a light till we was about ten mile below the villageThen we lit up and had a supper and the king and the duke fairlylaughed their bones loose over the way theyd served them people  Theduke saysGreenhorns flatheads  I knew the first house would keep mum and letthe rest of the town get roped in and I knew theyd lay for us thethird night and consider it was their turn now  Well it is theirturn and Id give something to know how much theyd take for it  Iwould just like to know how theyre putting in their opportunity They can turn it into a picnic if they want tothey brought plentyprovisionsThem rapscallions took in four hundred and sixtyfive dollars in thatthree nights  I

my turn  He oftendone that  When I waked up just at daybreak he was sitting there withhis head down betwixt his knees moaning and mourning to himself  Ididnt take notice nor let on  I knowed what it was about  He wasthinking about his wife and his children away up yonder and he was lowand homesick because he hadnt ever been away from home before in hislife and I do believe he cared just as much for his people as whitefolks does for theirn  It dont seem natural but I reckon its so He was often moaning and mourning that way nights when he judged Iwas asleep and saying Po little Lizabeth po

middle where there was a village on each side of the river and theduke and the king begun to lay out a plan for working them towns  Jimhe spoke to the duke and said he hoped it wouldnt take but a fewhours because it got mighty heavy and tiresome to him when he had tolay all day in the wigwam tied with the rope  You see when we left himall alone we had to tie him because if anybody happened on to him allby himself and not tied it wouldnt look much like he was a runawaynigger you know So the duke said it was kind of hard to have to layroped all day and hed cipher out some way to get around itHe was uncommon bright the duke was and he soon struck it  He dressedJim up in King Lears outfitit was a long curtaincalico gown and awhite horsehair wig and whiskers and then he took his theater paintand painted Jims face and hands and ears and neck all over a deaddull solid blue like a man thats been drownded nine days  Blamed ifhe warnt the horriblest looking outrage I ever see  Then the duke tookand wrote out a sign on a shingle soSick Arabbut harmless when not out of his headAnd he nailed that shingle to a lath and stood the lath up four or fivefoot in front of the wigwam  Jim was satisfied  He said it was a sightbetter than lying tied a couple of years every day and trembling allover every time there was a sound  The duke told him to make himselffree and easy and if anybody ever come meddling around he must hopout of the wigwam and carry on a little and fetch a howl or two likea wild beast and he reckoned they would light out and leave him alone Which was sound enough judgment but you take the average man and hewouldnt wait for him to howl  Why he didnt only look like he wasdead he looked considerable more than thatThese rapscallions wanted to try the Nonesuch again because there wasso much money in it but they judged it wouldnt be safe because maybethe news might a worked along down by this time  They couldnt hit noproject that suited exactly so at last the duke said he reckoned hedlay off and work his brains an hour or two and see if he couldnt put upsomething on the Arkansaw village and the king he allowed he would dropover to tother village without any plan but just trust in Providenceto lead him the profitable waymeaning the devil I reckon  We had allbought store clothes where we stopped last and now the king put hisnon and he told me to put mine on  I done it of course  The kingsduds was all black and he did look real swell and starchy  I neverknowed how clothes could change a body before  Why before he lookedlike the orneriest old rip that ever was but now when hed take offhis new white beaver and make a bow and do a smile he looked that grandand good and pious that youd say he had walked right out of the arkand maybe was old Leviticus himself  Jim cleaned up the canoe and Igot my paddle ready  There was a big steamboat laying at the shore awayup under the point about three mile above the townbeen there a coupleof hours taking on freight  Says the kingSeein how Im dressed I reckon maybe I better arrive down from StLouis or Cincinnati or some other big place  Go for the steamboatHuckleberry well come down to the village on herI didnt have to be ordered twice to go and take a steamboat ride I fetched the shore a half a mile above the village and then wentscooting along the bluff bank in the easy water  Pretty soon we come toa nice innocentlooking young country jake setting on a log swabbing thesweat off of his face for it was powerful warm weather and he had acouple of big carpetbags by himRun her nose in shore says the king  I done it  Wher you boundfor young manFor the steamboat going to OrleansGit aboard says the king  Hold on a minute my servant ll hep youwith them bags  Jump out and hep the gentleman Adolphusmeaning meI seeI done so and then we all three started on again  The young chap wasmighty thankful said it was tough work toting his baggage such weatherHe asked the king where he was going and the king told him hed comedown the river and landed at the other village this morning and now hewas going up a few mile to see an old friend on a farm up there  Theyoung fellow saysWhen I first see you I says to myself Its Mr Wilks sure and hecome mighty near getting here in time  But then I says again No Ireckon it aint him or else he wouldnt be paddling up the river  Youaint him are youNo my names BlodgettElexander BlodgettReverend ElexanderBlodgett I spose I must say as Im one o the Lords poor servants But still Im jist as able to be sorry for Mr Wilks for not arrivingin time all the same if hes missed anything by itwhich I hope hehasntWell he dont miss any property by it because hell get that allright but hes missed seeing his brother Peter diewhich he mayntmind nobody can tell as to thatbut his brother would a give anythingin this world to see him before he died never talked about nothingelse all these three weeks hadnt seen him since they was boystogetherand hadnt ever seen his brother William at allthats the deefand dumb oneWilliam aint more than thirty or thirtyfive  Peter andGeorge were the only ones that come out here George was the marriedbrother him and his wife both died last year  Harvey and Williams theonly ones thats left now and as I was saying they havent got herein timeDid anybody send em wordOh yes a month or two ago when Peter was first took because Petersaid then that he sorter felt like he warnt going to get well thistime You see he was pretty old and Georges gyirls was too young tobe much company for him except Mary Jane the redheaded one and so hewas kinder lonesome after George and his wife died and didnt seemto care much to live  He most desperately wanted to see HarveyandWilliam too for that matterbecause he was one of them kind that cantbear to make a will  He left a letter behind for Harvey and said hedtold in it where his money was hid and how he wanted the rest of theproperty divided up so Georges gyirls would be all rightfor Georgedidnt leave nothing  And that letter was all they could get him to puta pen toWhy do you reckon Harvey dont come  Wher does he liveOh he lives in EnglandSheffieldpreaches therehasnt ever been inthis country  He hasnt had any too much timeand besides he mightnt agot the letter at all you knowToo bad too bad he couldnt a lived to see his brothers poor soulYou going to Orleans you sayYes but that aint only a part of it  Im going in a ship nextWednesday for Ryo Janeero where my uncle livesIts a pretty long journey  But itll be lovely wisht I was agoingIs Mary Jane the oldest  How old is the othersMary Janes nineteen Susans fifteen and Joannas aboutfourteenthats the one that gives herself to good works and has aharelipPoor things to be left alone in the cold world soWell they could be worse off  Old Peter had friends and theyaint going to let them come to no harm  Theres Hobson the Babtispreacher and Deacon Lot Hovey and Ben Rucker and Abner Shacklefordand Levi Bell the lawyer and Dr Robinson and their wives and thewidow Bartley andwell theres a lot of them but these are the onesthat Peter was thickest with and used to write about sometimes whenhe wrote home so Harvey ll know where to look for friends when he getshereWell the old man went on asking questions till he just fairly emptiedthat young fellow  Blamed if he didnt inquire about everybody andeverything in that blessed town and all about the Wilkses and aboutPeters businesswhich was a tanner and about Georgeswhich was acarpenter and about Harveyswhich was a dissentering minister and soon and so on  Then he saysWhat did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat forBecause shes a big Orleans boat and I was afeard she mightnt stopthere  When theyre deep they wont stop for a hail  A Cincinnati boatwill but this is a St Louis oneWas Peter Wilks well offOh yes pretty well off  He had houses and land and its reckoned heleft three or four thousand in cash hid up somersWhen did you say he diedI didnt say but it was last nightFuneral tomorrow likelyYes bout the middle of the dayWell its all terrible sad but weve all got to go one time oranother So what we want to do is to be prepared then were all rightYes sir its the best way  Ma used to always say thatWhen we struck the boat she was about done loading and pretty soon shegot off  The king never said nothing about going aboard so I lostmy ride after all  When the boat was gone the king made me paddle upanother mile to a lonesome place and then he got ashore and saysNow hustle back right off and fetch the duke up here and the newcarpetbags  And if hes gone over to tother side go over there andgit him  And tell him to git himself up regardless  Shove along nowI see what he was up to but I never said nothing of course  WhenI got back with the duke we hid the canoe and then they set down on alog and the king told him everything just like the young fellow hadsaid itevery last word of it  And all the time he was adoing it hetried to talk like an Englishman and he done it pretty well too fora slouch I cant imitate him and so I aint agoing to try to but hereally done it pretty good  Then he saysHow are you on the deef and dumb BilgewaterThe duke said leave him alone for that said he had played a deefand dumb person on the histronic boards  So then they waited for asteamboatAbout the middle of the afternoon a couple of little boats come alongbut they didnt come from high enough up the river but at last therewas a big one and they hailed her  She sent out her yawl and we wentaboard and she was from Cincinnati and when they found we only wantedto go four or five mile they was booming mad and gave us a cussing andsaid they wouldnt land us  But the king was cam  He saysIf gentlemen kin afford to pay a dollar a mile apiece to be took on andput off in a yawl a steamboat kin afford to carry em cant itSo they softened down and said it was all right and when we got to thevillage they yawled us ashore  About two dozen men flocked down whenthey see the yawl acoming and when the king saysKin any of you gentlemen tell me wher Mr Peter Wilks lives theygive a glance at one another and nodded their heads as much as to sayWhat d I tell you  Then one of them says kind of soft and gentleIm sorry sir but the best we can do is to tell you where he didlive yesterday eveningSudden as winking the ornery old cretur went an to smash and fell upagainst the man and put his chin on his shoulder and cried down hisback and saysAlas alas our poor brothergone and we never got to see him ohits too too hardThen he turns around blubbering and makes a lot of idiotic signs tothe duke on his hands and blamed if he didnt drop a carpetbag andbust out acrying  If they warnt the beatenest lot them two fraudsthat ever I struckWell the men gathered around and sympathized with them and said allsorts of kind things to them and carried their carpetbags up the hillfor them and let them lean on them and cry and told the king all abouthis brothers last moments and the king he told it all over again onhis hands to the duke and both of them took on about that dead tannerlike theyd lost the twelve disciples  Well if ever I struck anythinglike it Im a nigger It was enough to make a body ashamed of the humanraceCHAPTER XXVTHE news was all over town in two minutes and you could see the peopletearing down on the run from every which way some of them putting ontheir coats as they come  Pretty soon we was in the middle of a crowdand the noise of the tramping was like a soldier march  The windows anddooryards was full and every minute somebody would say over a fenceIs it themAnd somebody trotting along with the gang would answer back and sayYou bet it isWhen we got to the house the street in front of it was packed and thethree girls was standing in the door  Mary Jane was redheaded butthat dont make no difference she was most awful beautiful and herface and her eyes was all lit up like glory she was so glad her uncleswas come The king he spread his arms and Mary Jane she jumped forthem and the harelip jumped for the duke and there they had it Everybody most leastways women cried for joy to see them meet againat last and have such good timesThen the king he hunched the duke privateI see him do itand then helooked around and see the coffin over in the corner on two chairs sothen him and the duke with a hand across each others shoulder andtother hand to their eyes walked slow and solemn over there everybodydropping back to give them room and all the talk and noise stoppingpeople saying Sh and all the men taking their hats off and droopingtheir heads so you could a heard a pin fall  And when they got therethey bent over and looked in the coffin and took one sight and thenthey bust out acrying so you could a heard them to Orleans most andthen they put their arms around each others necks and hung their chinsover each others shoulders and then for three minutes or maybe fourI never see two men leak the way they done  And mind you everybodywas doing the same and the place was that damp I never see anythinglike it Then one of them got on one side of the coffin and tother ontother side and they kneeled down and rested their foreheads on thecoffin and let on to pray all to themselves  Well when it cometo that it worked the crowd like you never see anything like it andeverybody broke down and went to sobbing right out loudthe poor girlstoo and every woman nearly went up to the girls without saying aword and kissed them solemn on the forehead and then put their handon their head and looked up towards the sky with the tears runningdown and then busted out and went off sobbing and swabbing and givethe next woman a show  I never see anything so disgustingWell by and by the king he gets up and comes forward a little andworks himself up and slobbers out a speech all full of tears andflapdoodle about its being a sore trial for him and his poor brotherto lose the diseased and to miss seeing diseased alive after the longjourney of four thousand mile but its a trial thats sweetened andsanctified to us by this dear sympathy and these holy tears and so hethanks them out of his heart and out of his brothers heart because outof their mouths they cant words being too weak and cold and all thatkind of rot and slush till it was just sickening and then he blubbersout a pious goodygoody Amen and turns himself loose and goes to cryingfit to bustAnd the minute the words were out of his mouth somebody over in thecrowd struck up the doxolojer and everybody joined in with all theirmight and it just warmed you up and made you feel as good as churchletting out Music is a good thing and after all that soulbutter andhogwash I never see it freshen up things so and sound so honest andbullyThen the king begins to work his jaw again and says how him and hisnieces would be glad if a few of the main principal friends of thefamily would take supper here with them this evening and help set upwith the ashes of the diseased and says if his poor brother layingyonder could speak he knows who he would name for they was names thatwas very dear to him and mentioned often in his letters and so he willname the same to wit as follows vizzRev Mr Hobson and DeaconLot Hovey and Mr Ben Rucker and Abner Shackleford and Levi Bell andDr Robinson and their wives and the widow BartleyRev Hobson and Dr Robinson was down to the end of the town ahuntingtogetherthat is I mean the doctor was shipping a sick man to totherworld and the preacher was pinting him right  Lawyer Bell was away upto Louisville on business  But the rest was on hand and so they allcome and shook hands with the king and thanked him and talked to himand then they shook hands with the duke and didnt say nothing but justkept asmiling and bobbing their heads like a passel of sapheads whilsthe made all sorts of signs with his hands and said Googoogoogoogooall the time like a baby that cant talkSo the king he blattered along and managed to inquire about prettymuch everybody and dog in town by his name and mentioned all sortsof little things that happened one time or another in the town or toGeorges family or to Peter  And he always let on that Peter wrote himthe things but that was a lie  he got every blessed one of them out ofthat young flathead that we canoed up to the steamboatThen Mary Jane she fetched the letter her father left behind and theking he read it out loud and cried over it  It give the dwellinghouseand three thousand dollars gold to the girls and it give the tanyardwhich was doing a good business along with some other houses andland worth about seven thousand and three thousand dollars in goldto Harvey and William and told where the six thousand cash was hid downcellar  So these two frauds said theyd go and fetch it up and haveeverything square and aboveboard and told me to come with a candle We shut the cellar door behind us and when they found the bagthey spilt it out on the floor and it was a lovely sight all themyallerboys  My the way the kings eyes did shine  He slaps the dukeon the shoulder and saysOh this aint bully nor nothn  Oh no I reckon not  Whybully it beats the Nonesuch dont itThe duke allowed it did  They pawed the yallerboys and sifted themthrough their fingers and let them jingle down on the floor and theking saysIt aint no use talkin bein brothers to a rich dead man andrepresentatives of furrin heirs thats got left is the line for you andme Bilge  Thish yer comes of trustn to Providence  Its the bestway in the long run  Ive tried em all and ther aint no betterwayMost everybody would a been satisfied with the pile and took it ontrust but no they must count it  So they counts it and it comes outfour hundred and fifteen dollars short  Says the kingDern him I wonder what he done with that four hundred and fifteendollarsThey worried over that awhile and ransacked all around for it  Thenthe duke saysWell he was a pretty sick man and likely he made a mistakeI reckonthats the way of it  The best ways to let it go and keep still aboutit  We can spare itOh shucks yes we can spare it  I dont kyer nothn boutthatits the count Im thinkin about  We want to be awful squareand open and aboveboard here you know  We want to lug this hyermoney up stairs and count it before everybodythen ther aint nothnsuspicious  But when the dead man says thers six thousn dollars youknow we dont want toHold on says the duke  Les make up the deffisit and he begun tohaul

yallerjackets and stack themupIt most busted them but they made up the six thousand clean and clearSay says the duke I got another idea  Les go up stairs and countthis money and then take and give it to the girlsGood land duke lemme hug you  Its the most dazzling idea at ever aman struck  You have certnly got the most astonishin head I ever seeOh this is the boss dodge ther aint no mistake bout it  Let emfetch along their suspicions now if they want tothis ll lay em outWhen we got upstairs everybody gethered around the table and the kinghe counted it and stacked it up three hundred dollars in a piletwentyelegant little piles  Everybody looked hungry at it and licked theirchops  Then they raked it into the bag again and I see the king beginto swell himself up for another speech  He saysFriends all my poor brother that lays yonder has done generous bythem thats left behind in the vale of sorrers  He has done generous bythese yer poor little lambs that he loved and sheltered and thats leftfatherless and motherless  Yes and we that knowed him knows that hewould a done more generous by em if he hadnt ben afeard o woundinhis dear William and me  Now wouldnt he  Ther aint no questionbout it in my mind  Well then what kind o brothers would it bethat d stand in his way at sech a time  And what kind o uncles wouldit be that d robyes robsech poor sweet lambs as these at he lovedso at sech a time  If I know Williamand I think I dohewell Illjest ask him He turns around and begins to make a lot of signs tothe duke with his hands and the duke he looks at him stupid andleatherheaded a while then all of a sudden he seems to catch hismeaning and jumps for the king googooing with all his might for joyand hugs him about fifteen times before he lets up  Then the king saysI knowed it I reckon that ll convince anybody the way he feelsabout it  Here Mary Jane Susan Joanner take the moneytake itall  Its the gift of him that lays yonder cold but joyfulMary Jane she went for him Susan and the harelip went for theduke and then such another hugging and kissing I never see yet  Andeverybody crowded up with the tears in their eyes and most shook thehands off of them frauds saying all the timeYou dear good soulshow lovelyhow could youWell then pretty soon all hands got to talking about the diseasedagain and how good he was and what a loss he was and all that andbefore long a big ironjawed man worked himself in there from outsideand stood alistening and looking and not saying anything and nobodysaying anything to him either because the king was talking and they wasall busy listening  The king was sayingin the middle of something hedstarted in onthey bein partickler friends o the diseased  Thats why theyreinvited here this evenin but tomorrow we want all to comeeverybodyfor he respected everybody he liked everybody and so its fitten thathis funeral orgies shd be publicAnd so he went amooning on and on liking to hear himself talk andevery little while he fetched in his funeral orgies again till the dukehe couldnt stand it no more so he writes on a little scrap of paperObsequies you old fool and folds it up and goes to googooing andreaching it over peoples heads to him  The king he reads it and putsit in his pocket and saysPoor William afflicted as he is his hearts aluz right  Asks meto invite everybody to come to the funeralwants me to make em allwelcome  But he neednt a worriedit was jest what I was atThen he weaves along again perfectly cam and goes to dropping in hisfuneral orgies again every now and then just like he done before  Andwhen he done it the third time he saysI say orgies not because its the common term because itaintobsequies bein the common termbut because orgies is the rightterm Obsequies aint used in England no more nowits gone out  Wesay orgies now in England  Orgies is better because it means the thingyoure after more exact  Its a word thats made up outn the Greekorgo outside open abroad and the Hebrew jeesum to plant coverup hence inter  So you see funeral orgies is an open er publicfuneralHe was the worst I ever struck  Well the ironjawed man he laughedright in his face  Everybody was shocked  Everybody says Whydoctor and Abner Shackleford saysWhy Robinson haint you heard the news  This is Harvey WilksThe king he smiled eager and shoved out his flapper and saysIs it my poor brothers dear good friend and physician  IKeep your hands off of me says the doctor  You talk like anEnglishman dont you  Its the worst imitation I ever heard  YouPeter Wilkss brother  Youre a fraud thats what you areWell how they all took on  They crowded around the doctor and tried toquiet him down and tried to explain to him and tell him how Harvey dshowed in forty ways that he was Harvey and knowed everybody by nameand the names of the very dogs and begged and begged him not to hurtHarveys feelings and the poor girls feelings and all that  But itwarnt no use he stormed right along and said any man that pretendedto be an Englishman and couldnt imitate the lingo no better than whathe did was a fraud and a liar  The poor girls was hanging to the kingand crying and all of a sudden the doctor ups and turns on them  HesaysI was your fathers friend and Im your friend and I warn you as afriend and an honest one that wants to protect you and keep you out ofharm and trouble to turn your backs on that scoundrel and have nothingto do with him the ignorant tramp with his idiotic Greek and Hebrewas he calls it  He is the thinnest kind of an impostorhas come herewith a lot of empty names and facts which he picked up somewheres andyou take them for proofs and are helped to fool yourselves by thesefoolish friends here who ought to know better  Mary Jane Wilks youknow me for your friend and for your unselfish friend too  Now listento me turn this pitiful rascal outI beg you to do it  Will youMary Jane straightened herself up and my but she was handsome  ShesaysHere is my answer  She hove up the bag of money and put it in thekings hands and says Take this six thousand dollars and invest forme and my sisters any way you want to and dont give us no receipt foritThen she put her arm around the king on one side and Susan and theharelip done the same on the other  Everybody clapped their hands andstomped on the floor like a perfect storm whilst the king held up hishead and smiled proud  The doctor saysAll right I wash my hands of the matter  But I warn you all that atime s coming when youre going to feel sick whenever you think of thisday And away he wentAll right doctor says the king kinder mocking him well try andget em to send for you which made them all laugh and they said itwas a prime good hitCHAPTER XXVIWELL when they was all gone the king he asks Mary Jane how they was offfor spare rooms and she said she had one spare room which would do forUncle William and shed give her own room to Uncle Harvey which wasa little bigger and she would turn into the room with her sisters andsleep on a cot and up garret was a little cubby with a pallet in itThe king said the cubby would do for his valleymeaning meSo Mary Jane took us up and she showed them their rooms which wasplain but nice  She said shed have her frocks and a lot of other trapstook out of her room if they was in Uncle Harveys way but he saidthey warnt  The frocks was hung along the wall and before them wasa curtain made out of calico that hung down to the floor  There was anold hair trunk in one corner and a guitarbox in another and all sortsof little knickknacks and jimcracks around like girls brisken up a roomwith  The king said it was all the more homely and more pleasanter forthese fixings and so dont disturb them  The dukes room was prettysmall but plenty good enough and so was my cubbyThat night they had a big supper and all them men and women was thereand I stood behind the king and the dukes chairs and waited on themand the niggers waited on the rest  Mary Jane she set at the head ofthe table with Susan alongside of her and said how bad the biscuitswas and how mean the preserves was and how ornery and tough the friedchickens wasand all that kind of rot the way women always do for toforce out compliments and the people all knowed everything was tiptopand said sosaid How do you get biscuits to brown so nice andWhere for the lands sake did you get these amazn pickles andall that kind of humbug talkytalk just the way people always does at asupper you knowAnd when it was all done me and the harelip had supper in the kitchenoff of the leavings whilst the others was helping the niggers clean upthe things  The harelip she got to pumping me about England and blestif I didnt think the ice was getting mighty thin sometimes  She saysDid you ever see the kingWho  William Fourth  Well I bet I havehe goes to our church  Iknowed he was dead years ago but I never let on  So when I says hegoes to our church she saysWhatregularYesregular  His pews right

HarveysHisn  What does he want with a pewWants it to set in  What did you reckon he wanted with itWhy I thought hed be in the pulpitRot him I forgot he was a preacher  I see I was up a stump again so Iplayed another chicken bone and got another think  Then I saysBlame it do you suppose there aint but one preacher to a churchWhy what do they want with moreWhatto preach before a king  I never did see such a girl as youThey dont have no less than seventeenSeventeen  My land  Why I wouldnt set out such a string as thatnot if I never got to glory  It must take em a weekShucks they dont all of em

theyre for style  Dont you know nothingWell I dont want to know no such foolishness as that  How isservants treated in England  Do they treat em better n we treat ourniggersNo  A servant aint nobody there  They treat them worse than dogsDont they give em holidays the way we do Christmas and New Yearsweek and Fourth of JulyOh just listen  A body could tell you haint ever been to Englandby that  Why Harelwhy Joanna they never see a holiday from yearsend to years end never go to the circus nor theater nor niggershows nor nowheresNor churchNor churchBut you always went to churchWell I was gone up again  I forgot I was the old mans servant  Butnext minute I whirled in on a kind of an explanation how a valley wasdifferent from a common servant and had to go to church whether hewanted to or not and set with the family on account of its being thelaw  But I didnt do it pretty good and when I got done I see shewarnt satisfied  She saysHonest injun now haint you been telling me a lot of liesHonest injun says INone of it at allNone of it at all  Not a lie in it says ILay your hand on this book and say itI see it warnt nothing but a dictionary so I laid my hand on it andsaid it  So then she looked a little better satisfied and saysWell then Ill believe some of it but I hope to gracious if Illbelieve the restWhat is it you wont believe Joe says Mary Jane stepping in withSusan behind her  It aint right nor kind for you to talk so to himand him a stranger and so far from his people  How would you like to betreated soThats always your way Maimalways sailing in to help somebody beforetheyre hurt  I haint done nothing to him  Hes told some stretchersI reckon and I said I wouldnt swallow it all and thats every bitand grain I did say  I reckon he can stand a little thing like thatcant heI dont care whether twas little or whether twas big hes here inour house and a stranger and it wasnt good of you to say it  If youwas in his place it would make you feel ashamed and so you oughtnt tosay a thing to another person that will make them feel ashamedWhy Mam he saidIt dont make no difference what he saidthat aint the thing  Thething is for you to treat him kind and not be saying things to makehim remember he aint in his own country and amongst his own folksI says to myself this is a girl that Im letting that old reptile robher of her moneyThen Susan she waltzed in and if youll believe me she did giveHarelip hark from the tombSays I to myself and this is another one that Im letting him rob herof her moneyThen Mary Jane she took another inning and went in sweet and lovelyagainwhich was her way but when she got done there warnt hardlyanything left o poor Harelip  So she holleredAll right then says the other girls you just ask his pardonShe done it too and she done it beautiful  She done it so beautifulit was good to hear and I wished I could tell her a thousand lies soshe could do it againI says to myself this is another one that Im letting him rob her ofher money  And when she got through they all jest laid theirselvesout to make me feel at home and know I was amongst friends  I felt soornery and low down and mean that I says to myself my minds made upIll hive that money for them or bustSo then I lit outfor bed I said meaning some time or another  WhenI got by myself I went to thinking the thing over  I says to myselfshall I go to that doctor private and blow on these frauds  Nothatwont do He might tell who told him then the king and the duke wouldmake it warm for me  Shall I go private and tell Mary Jane  NoIdasnt do it Her face would give them a hint sure theyve got themoney and theyd slide right out and get away with it  If she was tofetch in help Id get mixed up in the business before it was done withI judge  No there aint no good way but one  I got to steal thatmoney somehow and I got to steal it some way that they wont suspicionthat I done it Theyve got a good thing here and they aint agoingto leave till theyve played this family and this town for all theyreworth so Ill find a chance time enough Ill steal it and hide it andby and by when Im away down the river Ill write a letter and tellMary Jane where its hid  But I better hive it tonight if I canbecause the doctor maybe hasnt let up as much as he lets on he has hemight scare them out of here yetSo thinks I Ill go and search them rooms  Upstairs the hall wasdark but I found the dukes room and started to paw around it withmy hands but I recollected it wouldnt be much like the king to letanybody else take care of that money but his own self so then I went tohis room and begun to paw around there  But I see I couldnt do nothingwithout a candle and I dasnt light one of course  So I judged Idgot to do the other thinglay for them and eavesdrop  About that timeI hears their footsteps coming and was going to skip under the bed Ireached for it but it wasnt where I thought it would be but I touchedthe curtain that hid Mary Janes frocks so I jumped in behind that andsnuggled in amongst the gowns and stood there perfectly stillThey come in and shut the door and the first thing the duke done was toget down and look under the bed  Then I was glad I hadnt found the bedwhen I wanted it  And yet you know its kind of natural to hide underthe bed when you are up to anything private  They sets down then andthe king saysWell what is it  And cut it middlin short because its better forus to be down there awhoopin up the mournin than up here givin em achance to talk us overWell this is it Capet  I aint easy I aint comfortable  Thatdoctor lays on my mind  I wanted to know your plans  Ive got anotion and I think its a sound oneWhat is it dukeThat we better glide out of this before three in the morning and clipit down the river with what weve got  Specially seeing we got it soeasygiven back to us flung at our heads as you may say when ofcourse we allowed to have to steal it back  Im for knocking off andlighting outThat made me feel pretty bad  About an hour or two ago it would a beena little different but now it made me feel bad and disappointed Theking rips out and saysWhat  And not sell out the rest o the property  March off likea passel of fools and leave eight or nine thousn dollars worth oproperty layin around jest sufferin to be scooped inand all goodsalable stuff tooThe duke he grumbled said the bag of gold was enough and he didntwant to go no deeperdidnt want to rob a lot of orphans of everythingthey hadWhy how you talk says the king  We shant rob em of nothing atall but jest this money  The people that buys the property is thesuffrers because as soon s its found out at we didnt own itwhichwont be long after weve slidthe sale wont be valid and it ll allgo back to the estate  These yer orphans ll git their house back aginand thats enough for them theyre young and spry and kn easyearn a livin  they aint agoin to suffer  Why jest thinktheresthousns and thousns that aint nigh so well off  Bless you theyaint got nothn to complain ofWell the king he talked him blind so at last he give in and said allright but said he believed it was blamed foolishness to stay and thatdoctor hanging over them  But the king saysCuss the doctor  What do we kyer for him  Haint we got all thefools in town on our side  And aint that a big enough majority in anytownSo they got ready to go down stairs again  The duke saysI dont think we put that money in a good placeThat cheered me up  Id begun to think I warnt going to get a hint ofno kind to help me  The king saysWhyBecause Mary Jane ll be in mourning from this out and first you knowthe nigger that does up the rooms will get an order to box these dudsup and put em away and do you reckon a nigger can run across money andnot borrow some of itYour heads level agin duke says the king and he comes afumblingunder the curtain two or three foot from where I was  I stuck tight tothe wall and kept mighty still though quivery and I wondered what themfellows would say to me if they catched me and I tried to think whatId better do if they did catch me  But the king he got the bag beforeI could think more than about a half a thought and he never suspicionedI was around  They took and shoved the bag through a rip in the strawtick that was under the featherbed and crammed it in a foot or twoamongst the straw and said it was all right now because a nigger onlymakes up the featherbed and dont turn over the straw tick only abouttwice a year and so it warnt in no danger of getting stole nowBut I knowed better  I had it out of there before they was halfwaydown stairs  I groped along up to my cubby and hid it there till Icould get a chance to do better  I judged I better hide it outsideof the house somewheres because if they missed it they would give thehouse a good ransacking  I knowed that very well  Then I turned inwith my clothes all on but I couldnt a gone to sleep if Id a wantedto I was in such a sweat to get through with the business  By and by Iheard the king and the duke come up so I rolled off my pallet and laidwith my chin at the top of my ladder and waited to see if anything wasgoing to happen  But nothing didSo I held on till all the late sounds had quit and the early ones hadntbegun yet and then I slipped down the ladderCHAPTER XXVIII crept to their doors and listened they was snoring  So I tiptoedalong and got down stairs all right  There warnt a sound anywheres I peeped through a crack of the diningroom door and see the men thatwas watching the corpse all sound asleep on their chairs  The doorwas open into the parlor where the corpse was laying and there was acandle in both rooms I passed along and the parlor door was open butI see there warnt nobody in there but the remainders of Peter so Ishoved on by but the front door was locked and the key wasnt there Just then I heard somebody coming down the stairs back behind me  Irun in the parlor and took a swift look around and the only place Isee to hide the bag was in the coffin  The lid was shoved along abouta foot showing the dead mans face down in there with a wet cloth overit and his shroud on  I tucked the moneybag in under the lid justdown beyond where his hands was crossed which made me creep they wasso cold and then I run back across the room and in behind the doorThe person coming was Mary Jane  She went to the coffin very soft andkneeled down and looked in then she put up her handkerchief and I seeshe begun to cry though I couldnt hear her and her back was to me  Islid out and as I passed the diningroom I thought Id make sure themwatchers hadnt seen me so I looked through the crack and everythingwas all right  They hadnt stirredI slipped up to bed feeling ruther blue on accounts of the thingplaying out that way after I had took so much trouble and run so muchresk about it  Says I if it could stay where it is all right becausewhen we get down the river a hundred mile or two I could write back toMary Jane and she could dig him up again and get it but that aint thething thats going to happen the thing thats going to happen is themoney ll be found when they come to screw on the lid  Then the kingll get it again and it ll be a long day before he gives anybodyanother chance to smouch it from him Of course I wanted to slidedown and get it out of there but I dasnt try it  Every minute it wasgetting earlier now and pretty soon some of them watchers would beginto stir and I might get catchedcatched with six thousand dollars in myhands that nobody hadnt hired me to take care of  I dont wish to bemixed up in no such business as that I says to myselfWhen I got down stairs in the morning the parlor was shut up and thewatchers was gone  There warnt nobody around but the family and thewidow Bartley and our tribe  I watched their faces to see if anythinghad been happening but I couldnt tellTowards the middle of the day the undertaker come with his man and theyset the coffin in the middle of the room on a couple of chairs and thenset all our chairs in rows and borrowed more from the neighbors tillthe hall and the parlor and the diningroom was full  I see the coffinlid was the way it was before but I dasnt go to look in under it withfolks aroundThen the people begun to flock in and the beats and the girls tookseats in the front row at the head of the coffin and for a half an hourthe people filed around slow in single rank and looked down at thedead mans face a minute and some dropped in a tear and it wasall very still and solemn only the girls and the beats holdinghandkerchiefs to their eyes and keeping their heads bent and sobbing alittle  There warnt no other sound but the scraping of the feet onthe floor and blowing nosesbecause people always blows them more at afuneral than they do at other places except churchWhen the place was packed full the undertaker he slid around in hisblack gloves with his softy soothering ways putting on the lasttouches and getting people and things all shipshape and comfortableand making no more sound than a cat  He never spoke he moved peoplearound he squeezed in late ones he opened up passageways and doneit with nods and signs with his hands  Then he took his place overagainst the wall He was the softest glidingest stealthiest man I eversee and there warnt no more smile to him than there is to a hamThey had borrowed a melodeuma sick one and when everything was readya young woman set down and worked it and it was pretty skreeky andcolicky and everybody joined in and sung and Peter was the only onethat had a good thing according to my notion  Then the Reverend Hobsonopened up slow and solemn and begun to talk and straight off the mostoutrageous row busted out in the cellar a body ever heard it was onlyone dog but he made a most powerful racket and he kept it up rightalong the parson he had to stand there over the coffin and waityoucouldnt hear yourself think  It was right down awkward and nobodydidnt seem to know what to do  But pretty soon they see thatlonglegged undertaker make a sign to the preacher as much as to sayDont you worryjust depend on me  Then he stooped down and begunto glide along the wall just his shoulders showing over the peoplesheads  So he glided along and the powwow and racket getting more andmore outrageous all the time and at last when he had gone around twosides of the room he disappears down cellar  Then in about two secondswe heard a whack and the dog he finished up with a most amazing howl ortwo and then everything was dead still and the parson begun his solemntalk where he left off  In a minute or two here comes this undertakersback and shoulders gliding along the wall again and so he glided andglided around three sides of the room and then rose up and shaded hismouth with his hands and stretched his neck out towards the preacherover the peoples heads and says in a kind of a coarse whisper Hehad a rat  Then he drooped down and glided along the wall again tohis place  You could see it was a great satisfaction to the peoplebecause naturally they wanted to know  A little thing like that dontcost nothing and its just the little things that makes a man to belooked up to and liked  There warnt no more popular man in town thanwhat that undertaker wasWell the funeral sermon was very good but pison long and tiresome andthen the king he shoved in and got off some of his usual rubbage andat last the job was through and the undertaker begun to sneak up on thecoffin with his screwdriver  I was in a sweat then and watched himpretty keen But he never meddled at all just slid the lid along assoft as mush and screwed it down tight and fast  So there I was  Ididnt know whether the money was in there or not  So says I sposesomebody has hogged that bag on the slynow how do I know whetherto write to Mary Jane or not Spose she dug him up and didnt findnothing what would she think of me Blame it I says I might gethunted up and jailed Id better lay low and keep dark and not write atall the things awful mixed now trying to better it Ive worsened ita hundred times and I wish to goodness Id just let it alone dad fetchthe whole businessThey buried him and we come back home and I went to watching facesagainI couldnt help it and I couldnt rest easy  But nothing come ofit the faces didnt tell me nothingThe king he visited around in the evening and sweetened everybody upand made himself ever so friendly and he give out the idea that hiscongregation over in England would be in a sweat about him so he musthurry and settle up the estate right away and leave for home  He wasvery sorry he was so pushed and so was everybody they wished he couldstay longer but they said they could see it couldnt be done  And hesaid of course him and William would take the girls home with them andthat pleased everybody too because then the girls would be well fixedand amongst their own relations and it pleased the girls tootickledthem so they clean forgot they ever had a trouble in the world and toldhim to sell out as quick as he wanted to they would be ready  Thempoor things was that glad and happy it made my heart ache to see themgetting fooled and lied to so but I didnt see no safe way for me tochip in and change the general tuneWell blamed if the king didnt bill the house and the niggers and allthe property for auction straight offsale two days after the funeralbut anybody could buy private beforehand if they wanted toSo the next day after the funeral along about noontime the girls joygot the first jolt  A couple of nigger traders come along and the kingsold them the niggers reasonable for threeday drafts as they calledit and away they went the two sons up the river to Memphis and theirmother down the river to Orleans  I thought them poor girls and themniggers would break their hearts for grief they cried around eachother and took on so it most made me down sick to see it  The girlssaid they hadnt ever dreamed of seeing the family separated or soldaway from the town  I cant ever get it out of my memory the sight ofthem poor miserable girls and niggers hanging around each others necksand crying and I reckon I couldnt a stood it all but would a hadto bust out and tell on our gang if I hadnt knowed the sale warnt noaccount and the niggers would be back home in a week or twoThe thing made a big stir in the town too and a good many come outflatfooted and said it was scandalous to separate the mother and thechildren that way  It injured the frauds some but the old fool hebulled right along spite of all the duke could say or do and I tellyou the duke was powerful uneasyNext day was auction day  About broad day in the morning the king andthe duke come up in the garret and woke me up and I see by their lookthat there was trouble  The king saysWas you in my room night before lastNo your majestywhich was the way I always called him when nobody butour gang warnt aroundWas you in there yisterday er last nightNo your majestyHonor bright nowno liesHonor bright your majesty Im telling you the truth  I haint beenanear your room since Miss Mary Jane took you and the duke and showedit to youThe duke saysHave you seen anybody else go in thereNo your grace not as I remember I believeStop and thinkI studied awhile and see my chance then I saysWell I see the niggers go in there several timesBoth of them gave a little jump and looked like they hadnt everexpected it and then like they had  Then the duke saysWhat all of themNoleastways not all at oncethat is I dont think I ever see themall come out at once but just one timeHello  When was thatIt was the day we had the funeral  In the morning  It warnt earlybecause I overslept  I was just starting down the ladder and I seethemWell go on go on  What did they do  Howd they actThey didnt do nothing  And they didnt act anyway much as fur as Isee They tiptoed away so I seen easy enough that theyd shoved inthere to do up your majestys room or something sposing you was upand found you warnt up and so they was hoping to slide out of theway of trouble without waking you up if they hadnt already waked youupGreat guns this is a go says the king and both of them lookedpretty sick and tolerable silly  They stood there athinking andscratching their heads a minute and the duke he bust into a kind of alittle raspy chuckle and saysIt does beat all how neat the niggers played their hand  They let onto be sorry they was going out of this region  And I believed theywas sorry and so did you and so did everybody  Dont ever tell meany more that a nigger aint got any histrionic talent  Why the waythey played that thing it would fool anybody  In my opinion theresa fortune in em  If I had capital and a theater I wouldnt want abetter layout than thatand here weve gone and sold em for a song Yes and aint privileged to sing the song yet  Say where is thatsongthat draftIn the bank for to be collected  Where would it beWell thats all right then thank goodnessSays I kind of timidlikeIs something gone wrongThe king whirls on me and rips outNone o your business  You keep your head shet and mind yr ownaffairsif you got any  Long as youre in this town dont you forgitthatyou hear  Then he says to the duke We got to jest swaller itand say nothn  mums the word for usAs they was starting down the ladder the duke he chuckles again andsaysQuick sales and small profits  Its a good businessyesThe king snarls around on him and saysI was trying to do for the best in sellin em out so quick  If theprofits has turned out to be none lackin considable and none tocarry is it my fault any moren its yournWell theyd be in this house yet and we wouldnt if I could a gotmy advice listened toThe king sassed back as much as was safe for him and then swappedaround and lit into me again  He give me down the banks for notcoming and telling him I see the niggers come out of his room actingthat waysaid any fool would a knowed something was up  And thenwaltzed in and cussed himself awhile and said it all come of him notlaying late and taking his natural rest that morning and hed beblamed if hed ever do it again  So they went off ajawing and I feltdreadful glad Id worked it all off on to the niggers and yet hadntdone the niggers no harm by itCHAPTER XXVIIIBY and by it was gettingup time  So I come down the ladder and startedfor downstairs but as I come to the girls room the door was open andI see Mary Jane setting by her old hair trunk which was open and shedbeen packing things in itgetting ready to go to England  But shehad stopped now with a folded gown in her lap and had her face in herhands crying  I felt awful bad to see it of course anybody would  Iwent in there and saysMiss Mary Jane you cant abear to see people in trouble and Icantmost always  Tell me about itSo she done it  And it was the niggersI just expected it  She saidthe beautiful trip to England was most about spoiled for her she didntknow how she was ever going to be happy there knowing the mother andthe children warnt ever going to see each other no moreand then bustedout bitterer than ever and flung up her hands and saysOh dear dear to think they aint ever going to see each other anymoreBut they willand inside of two weeksand I know it says ILaws it was out before I could think  And before I could budge shethrows her arms around my neck and told me to say it again say itagain say it againI see I had spoke too sudden and said too much and was in a closeplace I asked her to let me think a minute and she set there veryimpatient and excited and handsome but looking kind of happy andeasedup like a person thats had a tooth pulled out  So I went tostudying it out  I says to myself I reckon a body that ups and tellsthe truth when he is in a tight place is taking considerable many resksthough I aint had no experience and cant say for certain but itlooks so to me anyway and yet heres a case where Im blest if itdont look to me like the truth is better and actuly safer than a lie I must lay it by in my mind and think it over some time or other itsso kind of strange and unregular I never see nothing like it  Well Isays to myself at last Im agoing to chance it Ill up and tell thetruth this time though it does seem most like setting down on a kag ofpowder and touching it off just to see where youll go to Then I saysMiss Mary Jane is there any place out of town a little ways where youcould go and stay three or four daysYes Mr Lothrops  WhyNever mind why yet  If Ill tell you how I know the niggers will seeeach other again inside of two weekshere

it than another mans kisstheBible  Shesmiled and reddened up very sweet and I says If you dont mind itIll shut the doorand bolt itThen I come back and set down again and saysDont you holler  Just set still and take it like a man  I got totell the truth and you want to brace up Miss Mary because its abad kind and going to be hard to take but there aint no help forit  These uncles of yourn aint no uncles at all theyre a couple offraudsregular deadbeats  There now were over the worst of it youcan stand the rest middling easyIt jolted her up like everything of course but I was over the shoalwater now so I went right along her eyes ablazing higher and higherall the time and told her every blame thing from where we first struckthat young fool going up to the steamboat clear through to where sheflung herself on to the kings breast at the front door and he kissedher sixteen or seventeen timesand then up she jumps with her faceafire like sunset and saysThe brute  Come dont waste a minutenot a secondwell have themtarred and feathered and flung in the riverSays ICertnly  But do you mean before you go to Mr Lothrops orOh she says what am I thinking about she says and set rightdown again

I didnt say nothing then I saysId ruther not tell you where I put it Miss Mary Jane if you dontmind letting me off but Ill write it for you on a piece of paper andyou can read it along the road to Mr Lothrops if you want to  Do youreckon that ll doOh yesSo I wrote  I put it in the coffin  It was in there when you wascrying there away in the night  I was behind the door and I wasmighty sorry for you Miss Mary JaneIt made my eyes water a little to remember her crying there all byherself in the night and them devils laying there right under her ownroof shaming her and robbing her and when I folded it up and give itto her I see the water come into her eyes too and she shook me by thehand hard and saysGoodbye  Im going to do everything just as youve told me and ifI dont ever see you again I shant ever forget you and Ill think ofyou a many and a many a time and Ill pray for you tooand she wasgonePray for me  I reckoned if she knowed me shed take a job that was morenearer her size  But I bet she done it just the sameshe was just thatkind  She had the grit to pray for Judus if she took the notiontherewarnt no backdown to her I judge  You may say what you want to butin my opinion she had more sand in her than any girl I ever see inmy opinion she was just full of sand  It sounds like flattery but itaint no flattery  And when it comes to beautyand goodness tooshelays over them all  I haint ever seen her since that time that I seeher go out of that door no I haint ever seen her since but I reckonIve thought of her a many and a many a million times and of her sayingshe would pray for me and if ever Id a thought it would do any goodfor me to pray for her blamed if I wouldnt a done it or bustWell Mary Jane she lit out the back way I reckon because nobody seeher go  When I struck Susan and the harelip I saysWhats the name of them people over on tother side of the river thatyou all goes to see sometimesThey saysTheres several but its the Proctors mainlyThats the name I says I most forgot it  Well Miss Mary Jane shetold me to tell you shes gone over there in a dreadful hurryone ofthems sickWhich oneI dont know leastways I kinder forget but I thinks itsSakes alive I hope it

pluribusunum mumpsand so its my bounden duty to set down here and wait the three monthsit takes to show on her if shes got it  But never mind if you thinkits best to tell your uncle HarveyShucks and stay fooling around here when we could all be having goodtimes in England whilst we was waiting to find out whether Mary Janesgot it or not  Why you talk like a mugginsWell anyway maybe youd better tell some of the neighborsListen at that now  You do beat all for natural stupidness  Cantyou see that theyd go and tell  Ther aint no way but just to nottell anybody at allWell maybe youre rightyes I judge you are rightBut I reckon we ought to tell Uncle Harvey shes gone out a whileanyway so he wont be uneasy about herYes Miss Mary Jane she wanted you to do that  She says Tell them togive Uncle Harvey and William my love and a kiss and say Ive run overthe river to see MrMrwhat is the name of that rich family youruncle Peter used to think so much ofI mean the one thatWhy you must mean the Apthorps aint itOf course bother them kind of names a body cant ever seem toremember them half the time somehow  Yes she said say she has runover for to ask the Apthorps to be sure and come to the auction and buythis house because she allowed her uncle Peter would ruther they hadit than anybody else and shes going to stick to them till they saytheyll come and then if she aint too tired shes coming home andif she is shell be home in the morning anyway  She said dont saynothing about the Proctors but only about the Apthorpswhich ll beperfectly true because she is going there to speak about their buyingthe house I know it because she told me so herselfAll right they said and cleared out to lay for their uncles andgive them the love and the kisses and tell them the messageEverything was all right now  The girls wouldnt say nothing becausethey wanted to go to England and the king and the duke would rutherMary Jane was off working for the auction than around in reach ofDoctor Robinson  I felt very good I judged I had done it pretty neatIreckoned Tom Sawyer couldnt a done it no neater himself  Of course hewould a throwed more style into it but I cant do that very handy notbeing brung up to itWell they held the auction in the public square along towards the endof the afternoon and it strung along and strung along and the old manhe was on hand and looking his level pisonest up there longside of theauctioneer and chipping in a little Scripture now and then or a littlegoodygoody saying of some kind and the duke he was around googooingfor sympathy all he knowed how and just spreading himself generlyBut by and by the thing dragged through and everything wassoldeverything but a little old trifling lot in the graveyard  Sotheyd got to work that offI never see such a girafft as the king wasfor wanting to swallow everything  Well whilst they was at it asteamboat landed and in about two minutes up comes a crowd awhoopingand yelling and laughing and carrying on and singing outHeres your opposition line heres your two sets o heirs to oldPeter Wilksand you pays your money and you takes your choiceCHAPTER XXIXTHEY was fetching a very nicelooking old gentleman along and anicelooking younger one with his right arm in a sling  And my soulshow the people yelled and laughed and kept it up  But I didnt see nojoke about it and I judged it would strain the duke and the king someto see any  I reckoned theyd turn pale  But no nary a pale didthey turn The duke he never let on he suspicioned what was up butjust went a googooing around happy and satisfied like a jug thatsgoogling out buttermilk and as for the king he just gazed and gazeddown sorrowful on them newcomers like it give him the stomachache inhis very heart to think there could be such frauds and rascals in theworld  Oh he done it admirable  Lots of the principal peoplegethered around the king to let him see they was on his side  That oldgentleman that had just come looked all puzzled to death  Prettysoon he begun to speak and I see straight off he pronounced like anEnglishmannot the kings way though the kings was pretty good foran imitation  I cant give the old gents words nor I cant imitatehim but he turned around to the crowd and says about like thisThis is a surprise to me which I wasnt looking for and Illacknowledge candid and frank I aint very well fixed to meet it andanswer it for my brother and me has had misfortunes hes broke hisarm and our baggage got put off at a town above here last night in thenight by a mistake  I am Peter Wilks brother Harvey and this is hisbrother William which cant hear nor speakand cant even make signs toamount to much nowt hes only got one hand to work them with  We arewho we say we are and in a day or two when I get the baggage I canprove it But up till then I wont say nothing more but go to the hoteland waitSo him and the new dummy started off and the king he laughs andblethers outBroke his armvery likely aint itand very convenient toofor a fraud thats got to make signs and aint learnt how  Losttheir baggage Thats mighty goodand mighty ingeniousunder thecircumstancesSo he laughed again and so did everybody else except three or fouror maybe half a dozen  One of these was that doctor another one wasa sharplooking gentleman with a carpetbag of the oldfashioned kindmade out of carpetstuff that had just come off of the steamboat andwas talking to him in a low voice and glancing towards the king now andthen and nodding their headsit was Levi Bell the lawyer that was goneup to Louisville and another one was a big rough husky that come alongand listened to all the old gentleman said and was listening to theking now And when the king got done this husky up and saysSay looky here if you are Harvey Wilks whend you come to thistownThe day before the funeral friend says the kingBut what time o dayIn the eveninbout an hour er two before sundownHowd you comeI come down on the Susan Powell from CincinnatiWell then howd you come to be up at the Pint in the morninin acanoeI warnt up at the Pint in the morninIts a lieSeveral of them jumped for him and begged him not to talk that way to anold man and a preacherPreacher be hanged hes a fraud and a liar  He was up at the Pintthat mornin  I live up there dont I  Well I was up there andhe was up there  I see him there  He come in a canoe along with TimCollins and a boyThe doctor he up and saysWould you know the boy again if you was to see him HinesI reckon I would but I dont know  Why yonder he is now  I knowhim perfectly easyIt was me he pointed at  The doctor saysNeighbors I dont know whether the new couple is frauds or not but ifthese two aint frauds I am an idiot thats all  I think its ourduty to see that they dont get away from here till weve looked intothis thing Come along Hines come along the rest of you  Well takethese fellows to the tavern and affront them with tother couple and Ireckon well find out something before we get throughIt was nuts for the crowd though maybe not for the kings friends sowe all started  It was about sundown  The doctor he led me along bythe hand and was plenty kind enough but he never let go my handWe all got in a big room in the hotel and lit up some candles andfetched in the new couple  First the doctor saysI dont wish to be too hard on these two men but I think theyrefrauds and they may have complices that we dont know nothing about If they have wont the complices get away with that bag of gold PeterWilks left  It aint unlikely  If these men aint frauds they wontobject to sending for that money and letting us keep it till they provetheyre all rightaint that soEverybody agreed to that  So I judged they had our gang in a prettytight place right at the outstart  But the king he only lookedsorrowful and saysGentlemen I wish the money was there for I aint got no dispositionto throw anything in the way of a fair open outandout investigationo this misable business but alas the money aint there you kn sendand see if you want toWhere is it thenWell when my niece give it to me to keep for her I took and hid itinside o the straw tick o my bed not wishin to bank it for the fewdays wed be here and considerin the bed a safe place we not beinused to niggers and supposn em honest like servants in England The niggers stole it the very next mornin after I had went downstairs and when I sold em I hadnt missed the money yit so they gotclean away with it  My servant here kn tell you bout it gentlemenThe doctor and several said Shucks and I see nobody didnt altogetherbelieve him  One man asked me if I see the niggers steal it  I saidno but I see them sneaking out of the room and hustling away and Inever thought nothing only I reckoned they was afraid they had waked upmy master and was trying to get away before he made trouble with them That was all they asked me  Then the doctor whirls on me and saysAre you English tooI says yes and him and some others laughed and said StuffWell then they sailed in on the general investigation and there we hadit up and down hour in hour out and nobody never said a word aboutsupper nor ever seemed to think about itand so they kept it up andkept it up and it was the worst mixedup thing you ever see  Theymade the king tell his yarn and they made the old gentleman tell hisnand anybody but a lot of prejudiced chuckleheads would a seen that theold gentleman was spinning truth and tother one lies  And by and bythey had me up to tell what I knowed  The king he give me a lefthandedlook out of the corner of his eye and so I knowed enough to talk on theright side  I begun to tell about Sheffield and how we lived thereand all about the English Wilkses and so on but I didnt get prettyfur till the doctor begun to laugh and Levi Bell the lawyer saysSet down my boy I wouldnt strain myself if I was you  I reckonyou aint used to lying it dont seem to come handy what you want ispractice  You do it pretty awkwardI didnt care nothing for the compliment but I was glad to be let offanywayThe doctor he started to say something and turns and saysIf youd been in town at first Levi Bell The king broke in andreached out his hand and saysWhy is this my poor dead brothers old friend that hes wrote so oftenaboutThe lawyer and him shook hands and the lawyer smiled and lookedpleased and they talked right along awhile and then got to one sideand talked low and at last the lawyer speaks up and saysThat ll fix it  Ill take the order and send it along with yourbrothers and then theyll know its all rightSo they got some paper and a pen and the king he set down and twistedhis head to one side and chawed his tongue and scrawled off somethingand then they give the pen to the dukeand then for the first time theduke looked sick  But he took the pen and wrote  So then the lawyerturns to the new old gentleman and saysYou and your brother please write a line or two and sign your namesThe old gentleman wrote but nobody couldnt read it  The lawyer lookedpowerful astonished and saysWell it beats meand snaked a lot of old letters out of his pocketand examined them and then examined the old mans writing and thenthem again and then says  These old letters is from Harvey Wilksand heres these two handwritings and anybody can see they didntwrite them the king and the duke looked sold and foolish I tellyou to see how the lawyer had took them in and heres this oldgentlemans hand writing and anybody can tell easy enough he didntwrite themfact is the scratches he makes aint properly writing atall  Now heres some letters fromThe new old gentleman saysIf you please let me explain  Nobody can read my hand but my brotherthereso he copies for me  Its his hand youve got there not mineWell says the lawyer this is a state of things  Ive got someof Williams letters too so if youll get him to write a line or so wecan comHe cant write with his left hand says the old gentleman  If hecould use his right hand you would see that he wrote his own lettersand mine too  Look at both pleasetheyre by the same handThe lawyer done it and saysI believe its soand if it aint so theres a heap strongerresemblance than Id noticed before anyway  Well well well  Ithought we was right on the track of a solution but its gone to grasspartly  But anyway one thing is provedthese two aint either of emWilksesand he wagged his head towards the king and the dukeWell what do you think  That muleheaded old fool wouldnt give inthen Indeed he wouldnt  Said it warnt no fair test  Said hisbrother William was the cussedest joker in the world and hadnt triedto writehe see William was going to play one of his jokes the minutehe put the pen to paper  And so he warmed up and went warbling andwarbling right along till he was actuly beginning to believe what he wassaying himself but pretty soon the new gentleman broke in and saysIve thought of something  Is there anybody here that helped to layout my brhelped to lay out the late Peter Wilks for buryingYes says somebody me and Ab Turner done it  Were both hereThen the old man turns towards the king and saysPerhaps this gentleman can tell me what was tattooed on his breastBlamed if the king didnt have to brace up mighty quick or hed asqushed down like a bluff bank that the river has cut under it tookhim so sudden and mind you it was a thing that was calculated to makemost anybody sqush to get fetched such a solid one as that without anynotice because how was he going to know what was tattooed on the man He whitened a little he couldnt help it and it was mighty still inthere and everybody bending a little forwards and gazing at him  SaysI to myself now hell throw up the spongethere aint no more use Well did he  A body cant hardly believe it but he didnt  I reckonhe thought hed keep the thing up till he tired them people out sotheyd thin out and him and the duke could break loose and get away Anyway he set there and pretty soon he begun to smile and saysMf  Its a very tough question aint it  yes sir I kntell you whats tattooed on his breast  Its jest a small thin bluearrowthats what it is and if you dont look clost you cant see it now what do you sayheyWell I never see anything like that old blister for clean outandoutcheekThe new old gentleman turns brisk towards Ab Turner and his pard andhis eye lights up like he judged hed got the king this time andsaysThereyouve heard what he said  Was there any such mark on PeterWilks breastBoth of them spoke up and saysWe didnt see no such markGood says the old gentleman  Now what you did see on his breastwas a small dim P and a B which is an initial he dropped when he wasyoung and a W with dashes between them so  PBWand he markedthem that way on a piece of paper  Come aint that what you sawBoth of them spoke up again and saysNo we didnt  We never seen any marks at allWell everybody was in a state of mind now and they sings outThe whole bilin of m s frauds  Les duck em les drown emles ride em on a rail and everybody was whooping at once and therewas a rattling powwow  But the lawyer he jumps on the table and yellsand saysGentlemengentlemen  Hear me just a wordjust a single wordif youplease  Theres one way yetlets go and dig up the corpse and lookThat took themHooray they all shouted and was starting right off but the lawyerand the doctor sung outHold on hold on  Collar all these four men and the boy and fetchthem along tooWell do it they all shouted and if we dont find them marks welllynch the whole gangI was scared now I tell you  But there warnt no getting away youknow They gripped us all and marched us right along straight for thegraveyard which was a mile and a half down the river and the wholetown at our heels for we made noise enough and it was only nine in theeveningAs we went by our house I wished I hadnt sent Mary Jane out of townbecause now if I could tip her the wink shed light out and save me andblow on our deadbeatsWell we swarmed along down the river road just carrying on likewildcats and to make it more scary the sky was darking up and thelightning beginning to wink and flitter and the wind to shiver amongstthe leaves This was the most awful trouble and most dangersome I everwas in and I was kinder stunned everything was going so different fromwhat I had allowed for stead of being fixed so I could take my own timeif I wanted to and see all the fun and have Mary Jane at my back tosave me and set me free when the closefit come here was nothing in theworld betwixt me and sudden death but just them tattoomarks  If theydidnt find themI couldnt bear to think about it and yet somehow I couldnt thinkabout nothing else  It got darker and darker and it was a beautifultime to give the crowd the slip but that big husky had me by thewristHinesand a body might as well try to give Goliar the slip  Hedragged me right along he was so excited and I had to run to keep upWhen they got there they swarmed into the graveyard and washed over itlike an overflow  And when they got to the grave they found they hadabout a hundred times as many shovels as they wanted but nobody hadntthought to fetch a lantern  But they sailed into digging anyway by theflicker of the lightning and sent a man to the nearest house a half amile off to borrow oneSo they dug and dug like everything and it got awful dark and the rainstarted and the wind swished and swushed along and the lightning comebrisker and brisker and the thunder boomed but them people never tookno notice of it they was so full of this business and one minuteyou could see everything and every face in that big crowd and theshovelfuls of dirt sailing up out of the grave and the next second thedark wiped it all out and you couldnt see nothing at allAt last they got out the coffin and begun to unscrew the lid and thensuch another crowding and shouldering and shoving as there was toscrouge in and get a sight you never see and in the dark that way itwas awful  Hines he hurt my wrist dreadful pulling and tugging soand I reckon he clean forgot I was in the world he was so excited andpantingAll of a sudden the lightning let go a perfect sluice of white glareand somebody sings outBy the living jingo heres the bag of gold on his breastHines let out a whoop like everybody else and dropped my wrist andgive a big surge to bust his way in and get a look and the way I litout and shinned for the road in the dark there aint nobody can tellI had the road all to myself and I fairly flewleastways I had it allto myself except the solid dark and the nowandthen glares and thebuzzing of the rain and the thrashing of the wind and the splitting ofthe thunder and sure as you are born I did clip it alongWhen I struck the town I see there warnt nobody out in the storm soI never hunted for no back streets but humped it straight through themain one and when I begun to get towards our house I aimed my eye andset it No light there the house all darkwhich made me feel sorry anddisappointed I didnt know why  But at last just as I was sailing byflash comes the light in Mary Janes window and my heart swelled upsudden like to bust and the same second the house and all was behindme in the dark and wasnt ever going to be before me no more in thisworld She was the best girl I ever see and had the most sandThe minute I was far enough above the town to see I could make thetowhead I begun to look sharp for a boat to borrow and the firsttime the lightning showed me one that wasnt chained I snatched it andshoved It was a canoe and warnt fastened with nothing but a rope The towhead was a rattling big distance off away out there in themiddle of the river but I didnt lose no time and when I struck theraft at last I was so fagged I would a just laid down to blow and gaspif I could afforded it  But I didnt  As I sprung aboard I sung outOut with you Jim and set her loose  Glory be to goodness were shutof themJim lit out and was acoming for me with both arms spread he was sofull of joy but when I glimpsed him in the lightning my heart shot upin my mouth and I went overboard backwards for I forgot he was old KingLear and a drownded Arab all in one and it most scared the livers andlights out of me  But Jim fished me out and was going to hug me andbless me and so on he was so glad I was back and we was shut of theking and the duke but I saysNot now have it for breakfast have it for breakfast  Cut loose andlet her slideSo in two seconds away we went asliding down the river and it didseem so good to be free again and all by ourselves on the big river andnobody to bother us  I had to skip around a bit and jump up and crackmy heels a few timesI couldnt help it but about the third crackI noticed a sound that I knowed mighty well and held my breath andlistened and waited and sure enough when the next flash busted outover the water here they comeand just alaying to their oars andmaking their skiff hum  It was the king and the dukeSo I wilted right down on to the planks then and give up and it wasall I could do to keep from cryingCHAPTER XXXWHEN they got aboard the king went for me and shook me by the collarand saysTryin to give us the slip was ye you pup  Tired of our companyheyI saysNo your majesty we warntplease dont your majestyQuick then and tell us what was your idea or Ill shake theinsides out o youHonest Ill tell you everything just as it happened your majesty The man that had aholt of me was very good to me and kept saying hehad a boy about as big as me that died last year and he was sorryto see a boy in such a dangerous fix and when they was all took bysurprise by finding the gold and made a rush for the coffin he lets goof me and whispers Heel it now or theyll hang ye sure and I litout  It didnt seem no good for me to stayI couldnt do nothingand I didnt want to be hung if I could get away  So I never stoppedrunning till I found the canoe and when I got here I told Jim to hurryor theyd catch me and hang me yet and said I was afeard you and theduke wasnt alive now and I was awful sorry and so was Jim and wasawful glad when we see you coming you may ask Jim if I didntJim said it was so and the king told him to shut up and said Ohyes its mighty likely and shook me up again and said he reckonedhed drownd me  But the duke saysLeggo the boy you old idiot  Would you a done any different  Didyou inquire around for him when you got loose  I dont remember itSo the king let go of me and begun to cuss that town and everybody init But the duke saysYou better a blame sight give yourself a good cussing for yourethe one thats entitled to it most  You haint done a thing from thestart that had any sense in it except coming out so cool and cheekywith that imaginary bluearrow mark  That was brightit was rightdown bully and it was the thing that saved us  For if it hadnt beenfor that theyd a jailed us till them Englishmens baggage comeandthenthe penitentiary you bet But that trick took em to thegraveyard and the gold done us a still bigger kindness for if theexcited fools hadnt let go all holts and made that rush to get alook wed a slept in our cravats tonightcravats warranted to weartoolonger than wed need emThey was still a minutethinking then the king says kind ofabsentminded likeMf  And we reckoned the niggers stole itThat made me squirmYes says the duke kinder slow and deliberate and sarcastic wedidAfter about a half a minute the king drawls outLeastways I didThe duke says the same wayOn the contrary I didThe king kind of ruffles up and saysLooky here Bilgewater whatr you referrin toThe duke says pretty briskWhen it comes to that maybe youll let me ask what was youreferring toShucks says the king very sarcastic but I dont knowmaybe you wasasleep and didnt know what you was aboutThe duke bristles up now and saysOh let up on this cussed nonsense do you take me for a blame foolDont you reckon I know who hid that money in that coffinYes sir  I know you do know because you done it yourselfIts a lieand the duke went for him  The king sings outTake yr hands offleggo my throatI take it all backThe duke saysWell you just own up first that you did hide that money thereintending to give me the slip one of these days and come back and digit up and have it all to yourselfWait jest a minute dukeanswer me this one question honest and fairif you didnt put the money there say it and Ill blieve you andtake back everything I saidYou old scoundrel I didnt and you know I didnt  There nowWell then I blieve you  But answer me only jest this one morenowdont git mad didnt you have it in your mind to hook the money andhide itThe duke never said nothing for a little bit then he saysWell I dont care if I did I didnt do it anyway  But you notonly had it in mind to do it but you done itI wisht I never die if I done it duke and thats honest  I wont sayI warnt goin to do it because I was but youI mean somebodygot inahead o meIts a lie  You done it and you got to say you done it orThe king began to gurgle and then he gasps outNoughI own upI was very glad to hear him say that it made me feel much more easierthan what I was feeling before  So the duke took his hands off andsaysIf you ever deny it again Ill drown you  Its well for you to setthere and blubber like a babyits fitten for you after the wayyouve acted I never see such an old ostrich for wanting to gobbleeverythingand I atrusting you all the time like you was my ownfather  You ought to been ashamed of yourself to stand by and hear itsaddled on to a lot of poor niggers and you never say a word for em It makes me feel ridiculous to think I was soft enough to believethat rubbage  Cuss you I can see now why you was so anxious to makeup the deffisityou wanted to get what money Id got out of the Nonesuchand one thing or another and scoop it allThe king says timid and still asnufflingWhy duke it was you that said make up the deffisit it warnt meDry up  I dont want to hear no more out of you says the duke  Andnow you see what you GOT by it  Theyve got all their own money backand all of ourn but a shekel or two besides  Glong to bed anddont you deffersit me no more deffersits long s you liveSo the king sneaked into the wigwam and took to his bottle for comfortand before long the duke tackled HIS bottle and so in about a half anhour they was as thick as thieves again and the tighter they got thelovinger they got and went off asnoring in each others arms  Theyboth got powerful mellow but I noticed the king didnt get mellowenough to forget to remember to not deny about hiding the moneybagagain  That made me feel easy and satisfied  Of course when they gotto snoring we had a long gabble and I told Jim everythingCHAPTER XXXIWE dasnt stop again at any town for days and days kept right alongdown the river  We was down south in the warm weather now and a mightylong ways from home  We begun to come to trees with Spanish moss onthem hanging down from the limbs like long gray beards  It was thefirst I ever see it growing and it made the woods look solemn anddismal  So now the frauds reckoned they was out of danger and theybegun to work the villages againFirst they done a lecture on temperance but they didnt make enoughfor them both to get drunk on  Then in another village they starteda dancingschool but they didnt know no more how to dance than akangaroo does so the first prance they made the general public jumpedin and pranced them out of town  Another time they tried to go atyellocution but they didnt yellocute long till the audience got up andgive them a solid good cussing and made them skip out  They tackledmissionarying and mesmerizing and doctoring and telling fortunes anda little of everything but they couldnt seem to have no luck  So atlast they got just about dead broke and laid around the raft as shefloated along thinking and thinking and never saying nothing by thehalf a day at a time and dreadful blue and desperateAnd at last they took a change and begun to lay their heads together inthe wigwam and talk low and confidential two or three hours at a timeJim and me got uneasy  We didnt like the look of it  We judged theywas studying up some kind of worse deviltry than ever  We turned itover and over and at last we made up our minds they was going to breakinto somebodys house or store or was going into the counterfeitmoneybusiness or something So then we was pretty scared and made up anagreement that we wouldnt have nothing in the world to do with suchactions and if we ever got the least show we would give them the coldshake and clear out and leave them behind Well early one morning wehid the raft in a good safe place about two mile below a little bit ofa shabby village named Pikesville and the king he went ashore and toldus all to stay hid whilst he went up to town and smelt around to seeif anybody had got any wind of the Royal Nonesuch there yet House torob you mean says I to myself and when you get through robbing ityoull come back here and wonder what has become of me and Jim and theraftand youll have to take it out in wondering And he said if hewarnt back by midday the duke and me would know it was all right andwe was to come alongSo we stayed where we was  The duke he fretted and sweated around andwas in a mighty sour way  He scolded us for everything and we couldntseem to do nothing right he found fault with every little thingSomething was abrewing sure  I was good and glad when midday comeand no king we could have a change anywayand maybe a chance for thechange on top of it  So me and the duke went up to the village andhunted around there for the king and by and by we found him in theback room of a little low doggery very tight and a lot of loafersbullyragging him for sport and he acussing and athreatening with allhis might and so tight he couldnt walk and couldnt do nothing tothem  The duke he begun to abuse him for an old fool and the kingbegun to sass back and the minute they was fairly at it I lit out andshook the reefs out of my hind legs and spun down the river road likea deer for I see our chance and I made up my mind that it would be along day before they ever see me and Jim again  I got down there allout of breath but loaded up with joy and sung outSet her loose Jim were all right nowBut there warnt no answer and nobody come out of the wigwam  Jim wasgone  I set up a shoutand then anotherand then another one and runthis way and that in the woods whooping and screeching but it warntno useold Jim was gone  Then I set down and cried I couldnt helpit But I couldnt set still long  Pretty soon I went out on the roadtrying to think what I better do and I run across a boy walking andasked him if hed seen a strange nigger dressed so and so and he saysYesWhereabouts says IDown to Silas Phelps place two mile below here  Hes a runawaynigger and theyve got him  Was you looking for himYou bet I aint  I run across him in the woods about an hour or twoago and he said if I hollered hed cut my livers outand told me to laydown and stay where I was and I done it  Been there ever since afeardto come outWell he says you neednt be afeard no more becuz theyve got himHe run off fm down South somersIts a good job they got himWell I reckon  Theres two hunderd dollars reward on him  Itslike picking up money outn the roadYes it isand I could a had it if Id been big enough I see himfirst Who nailed himIt was an old fellowa strangerand he sold out his chance in him forforty dollars becuz hes got to go up the river and cant wait  Thinko that now  You bet Id wait if it was seven yearThats me every time says I  But maybe his chance aint worthno more than that if hell sell it so cheap  Maybe theres somethingaint straight about itBut it is thoughstraight as a string  I see the handbill myself It tells all about him to a dotpaints him like a picture and tellsthe plantation hes frum below Newrleans  Nosirreebob theyaint no trouble bout that speculation you bet you  Say gimme achaw tobacker wont yeI didnt have none so he left  I went to the raft and set down in thewigwam to think  But I couldnt come to nothing  I thought till I woremy head sore but I couldnt see no way out of the trouble  After allthis long journey and after all wed done for them scoundrels here itwas all come to nothing everything all busted up and ruined becausethey could have the heart to serve Jim such a trick as that and makehim a slave again all his life and amongst strangers too for fortydirty dollarsOnce I said to myself it would be a thousand times better for Jim tobe a slave at home where his family was as long as hed got to be aslave and so Id better write a letter to Tom Sawyer and tell him totell Miss Watson where he was  But I soon give up that notion for twothings shed be mad and disgusted at his rascality and ungratefulnessfor leaving her and so shed sell him straight down the river againand if she didnt everybody naturally despises an ungrateful niggerand theyd make Jim feel it all the time and so hed feel ornery anddisgraced And then think of me  It would get all around that HuckFinn helped a nigger to get his freedom and if I was ever to seeanybody from that town again Id be ready to get down and lick his bootsfor shame  Thats just the way  a person does a lowdown thing andthen he dont want to take no consequences of it Thinks as long as hecan hide it it aint no disgrace  That was my fix exactly The more Istudied about this the more my conscience went to grinding me and themore wicked and lowdown and ornery I got to feeling And at last whenit hit me all of a sudden that here was the plain hand of Providenceslapping me in the face and letting me know my wickedness was beingwatched all the time from up there in heaven whilst I was stealing apoor old womans nigger that hadnt ever done me no harm and now wasshowing me theres One thats always on the lookout and aint agoingto allow no such miserable doings to go only just so fur and no furtherI most dropped in my tracks I was so scared  Well I tried the best Icould to kinder soften it up somehow for myself by saying I was brungup wicked and so I warnt so much to blame but something inside of mekept saying There was the Sundayschool you could a gone to it andif youd a done it theyd a learnt you there that people that acts asId been acting about that nigger goes to everlasting fireIt made me shiver  And I about made up my mind to pray and see if Icouldnt try to quit being the kind of a boy I was and be better  SoI kneeled down  But the words wouldnt come  Why wouldnt they  Itwarnt no use to try and hide it from Him  Nor from me neither  Iknowed very well why they wouldnt come  It was because my heart warntright it was because I warnt square it was because I was playingdouble  I was letting on to give up sin but away inside of me I washolding on to the biggest one of all  I was trying to make my mouthsay I would do the right thing and the clean thing and go and writeto that niggers owner and tell where he was but deep down in me Iknowed it was a lie and He knowed it  You cant pray a lieI foundthat outSo I was full of trouble full as I could be and didnt know what todo At last I had an idea and I says Ill go and write the letterandthen see if I can pray  Why it was astonishing the way I felt aslight as a feather right straight off and my troubles all gone  So Igot a piece of paper and a pencil all glad and excited and set downand wroteMiss Watson your runaway nigger Jim is down here two mile belowPikesville and Mr Phelps has got him and he will give him up for thereward if you sendHuck FinnI felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time I had everfelt so in my life and I knowed I could pray now  But I didnt do itstraight off but laid the paper down and set there thinkingthinkinghow good it was all this happened so and how near I come to being lostand going to hell  And went on thinking  And got to thinking over ourtrip down the river and I see Jim before me all the time  in the dayand in the nighttime sometimes moonlight sometimes storms and weafloating along talking and singing and laughing  But somehow Icouldnt seem to strike no places to harden me against him but only theother kind  Id see him standing my watch on top of hisn stead ofcalling me so I could go on sleeping and see him how glad he was whenI come back out of the fog and when I come to him again in the swampup there where the feud was and suchlike times and would always callme honey and pet me and do everything he could think of for me and howgood he always was and at last I struck the time I saved him by tellingthe men we had smallpox aboard and he was so grateful and said I wasthe best friend old Jim ever had in the world and the only one hesgot now and then I happened to look around and see that paperIt was a close place  I took it up and held it in my hand  I wasatrembling because Id got to decide forever betwixt two things andI knowed it  I studied a minute sort of holding my breath and thensays to myselfAll right then Ill go to helland tore it upIt was awful thoughts and awful words but they was said  And I letthem stay said and never thought no more about reforming  I shoved thewhole thing out of my head and said I would take up wickedness againwhich was in my line being brung up to it and the other warnt  Andfor a starter I would go to work and steal Jim out of slavery againand if I could think up anything worse I would do that too because aslong as I was in and in for good I might as well go the whole hogThen I set to thinking over how to get at it and turned over someconsiderable many ways in my mind and at last fixed up a plan thatsuited me  So then I took the bearings of a woody island that was downthe river a piece and as soon as it was fairly dark I crept out with myraft and went for it and hid it there and then turned in  I slept thenight through and got up before it was light and had my breakfastand put on my store clothes and tied up some others and one thing oranother in a bundle and took the canoe and cleared for shore  I landedbelow where I judged was Phelpss place and hid my bundle in the woodsand then filled up the canoe with water and loaded rocks into her andsunk her where I could find her again when I wanted her about a quarterof a mile below a little steam sawmill that was on the bankThen I struck up the road and when I passed the mill I see a sign onit Phelpss Sawmill and when I come to the farmhouses two orthree hundred yards further along I kept my eyes peeled but didntsee nobody around though it was good daylight now  But I didnt mindbecause I didnt want to see nobody just yetI only wanted to get thelay of the land According to my plan I was going to turn up there fromthe village not from below  So I just took a look and shoved alongstraight for town Well the very first man I see when I got there wasthe duke  He was sticking up a bill for the Royal Nonesuchthreenightperformancelike that other time  They had the cheek them frauds  Iwas right on him before I could shirk  He looked astonished and saysHello  Whered you come from  Then he says kind of glad andeager Wheres the raftgot her in a good placeI saysWhy thats just what I was going to ask your graceThen he didnt look so joyful and saysWhat was your idea for asking me he saysWell I says when I see the king in that doggery yesterday I saysto myself we cant get him home for hours till hes soberer so I wentaloafing around town to put in the time and wait  A man up and offeredme ten cents to help him pull a skiff over the river and back to fetcha sheep and so I went along but when we was dragging him to the boatand the man left me aholt of the rope and went behind him to shove himalong he was too strong for me and jerked loose and run and we afterhim  We didnt have no dog and so we had to chase him all over thecountry till we tired him out  We never got him till dark then wefetched him over and I started down for the raft  When I got there andsee it was gone I says to myself Theyve got into trouble and had toleave and theyve took my nigger which is the only nigger Ive got inthe world and now Im in a strange country and aint got no propertyno more nor nothing and no way to make my living so I set down andcried  I slept in the woods all night  But what did become of theraft thenand Jimpoor JimBlamed if I knowthat is whats become of the raft  That old fool hadmade a trade and got forty dollars and when we found him in the doggerythe loafers had matched halfdollars with him and got every cent butwhat hed spent for whisky and when I got him home late last night andfound the raft gone we said That little rascal has stole our raft andshook us and run off down the riverI wouldnt shake my nigger would Ithe only nigger I had in theworld and the only propertyWe never thought of that  Fact is I reckon wed come to consider himour nigger yes we did consider him sogoodness knows we had troubleenough for him  So when we see the raft was gone and we flat brokethere warnt anything for it but to try the Royal Nonesuch anothershake And Ive pegged along ever since dry as a powderhorn  Wheresthat ten cents Give it hereI had considerable money so I give him ten cents but begged him tospend it for something to eat and give me some because it was all themoney I had and I hadnt had nothing to eat since yesterday  He neversaid nothing  The next minute he whirls on me and saysDo you reckon that nigger would blow on us  Wed skin him if he donethatHow can he blow  Haint he run offNo  That old fool sold him and never divided with me and the moneysgoneSold him  I says and begun to cry why he was my nigger andthat was my money  Where is heI want my niggerWell you cant get your nigger thats allso dry up yourblubbering Looky heredo you think youd venture to blow on us Blamed if I think Id trust you  Why if you was to blow on usHe stopped but I never see the duke look so ugly out of his eyesbefore I went on awhimpering and saysI dont want to blow on nobody and I aint got no time to blow nohowI got to turn out and find my niggerHe looked kinder bothered and stood there with his bills fluttering onhis arm thinking and wrinkling up his forehead  At last he saysIll tell you something  We got to be here three days  If youllpromise you wont blow and wont let the nigger blow Ill tell youwhere to find himSo I promised and he saysA farmer by the name of Silas Ph and then he stopped  You see hestarted to tell me the truth but when he stopped that way and begun tostudy and think again I reckoned he was changing his mind  And so hewas He wouldnt trust me he wanted to make sure of having me out ofthe way the whole three days  So pretty soon he saysThe man that bought him is named Abram FosterAbram G Fosterand helives forty mile back here in the country on the road to LafayetteAll right I says I can walk it in three days  And Ill start thisvery afternoonNo you wont youll start now and dont you lose any time about itneither nor do any gabbling by the way  Just keep a tight tongue inyour head and move right along and then you wont get into trouble withus dye hearThat was the order I wanted and that was the one I played for  Iwanted to be left free to work my plansSo clear out he says and you can tell Mr Foster whatever you wantto Maybe you can get him to believe that Jim is your niggersomeidiots dont require documentsleastways Ive heard theres such downSouth here  And when you tell him the handbill and the rewards bogusmaybe hell believe you when you explain to him what the idea was forgetting em out  Go long now and tell him anything you want to butmind you dont work your jaw any between here and thereSo I left and struck for the back country  I didnt look around but Ikinder felt like he was watching me  But I knowed I could tire him outat that  I went straight out in the country as much as a mile beforeI stopped then I doubled back through the woods towards Phelps  Ireckoned I better start in on my plan straight off without foolingaround because I wanted to stop Jims mouth till these fellows couldget away  I didnt want no trouble with their kind  Id seen all Iwanted to of them and wanted to get entirely shut of themCHAPTER XXXIIWHEN I got there it was all still and Sundaylike and hot and sunshinythe hands was gone to the fields and there was them kind of faintdronings of bugs and flies in the air that makes it seem so lonesome andlike everybodys dead and gone and if a breeze fans along and quiversthe leaves it makes you feel mournful because you feel like itsspirits whisperingspirits thats been dead ever so many yearsand youalways think theyre talking about you  As a general thing it makes abody wish he was dead too and done with it allPhelps was one of these little onehorse cotton plantations and theyall look alike  A rail fence round a twoacre yard a stile made outof logs sawed off and upended in steps like barrels of a differentlength to climb over the fence with and for the women to stand on whenthey are going to jump on to a horse some sickly grasspatches in thebig yard but mostly it was bare and smooth like an old hat with thenap rubbed off big double loghouse for the white folkshewed logswith the chinks stopped up with mud or mortar and these mudstripesbeen whitewashed some time or another roundlog kitchen with a bigbroad open but roofed passage joining it to the house log smokehouseback of the kitchen three little log niggercabins in a row totherside the smokehouse one little hut all by itself away down againstthe back fence and some outbuildings down a piece the other sideashhopper and big kettle to bile soap in by the little hut bench bythe kitchen door with bucket of water and a gourd hound asleep therein the sun more hounds asleep round about about three shade trees awayoff in a corner some currant bushes and gooseberry bushes in one placeby the fence outside of the fence a garden and a watermelon patch thenthe cotton fields begins and after the fields the woodsI went around and clumb over the back stile by the ashhopper andstarted for the kitchen  When I got a little ways I heard the dim humof a spinningwheel wailing along up and sinking along down againand then I knowed for certain I wished I was deadfor that is thelonesomest sound in the whole worldI went right along not fixing up any particular plan but just trustingto Providence to put the right words in my mouth when the time come forId noticed that Providence always did put the right words in my mouthif I left it aloneWhen I got halfway first one hound and then another got up and wentfor me and of course I stopped and faced them and kept still  Andsuch another powwow as they made  In a quarter of a minute I was a kindof a hub of a wheel as you may sayspokes made out of dogscircle offifteen of them packed together around me with their necks and nosesstretched up towards me abarking and howling and more acoming youcould see them sailing over fences and around corners from everywheresA nigger woman come tearing out of the kitchen with a rollingpin in herhand singing out Begone you Tige you Spot begone sah and shefetched first one and then another of them a clip and sent them howlingand then the rest followed and the next second half of them come backwagging their tails around me and making friends with me  There aintno harm in a hound nohowAnd behind the woman comes a little nigger girl and two little niggerboys without anything on but towlinen shirts and they hung on to theirmothers gown and peeped out from behind her at me bashful the waythey always do  And here comes the white woman running from the houseabout fortyfive or fifty year old bareheaded and her spinningstickin her hand and behind her comes her little white children acting thesame way the little niggers was doing  She was smiling all over so shecould hardly standand saysIts you at lastaint itI out with a Yesm before I thoughtShe grabbed me and hugged me tight and then gripped me by both handsand shook and shook and the tears come in her eyes and run down overand she couldnt seem to hug and shake enough and kept saying Youdont look as much like your mother as I reckoned you would but lawsakes I dont care for that Im so glad to see you  Dear dear itdoes seem like I could eat you up  Children its your cousin Tomtellhim howdyBut they ducked their heads and put their fingers in their mouths andhid behind her  So she run onLize

after  When we gotthere she set me down in a splitbottomed chair and set herself down ona little low stool in front of me holding both of my hands and saysNow I can have a good look at you and lawsame

time I wanted to get them out to one side and pumpthem a little and find out who I was  But I couldnt get no show MrsPhelps kept it up and run on so  Pretty soon she made the cold chillsstreak all down my back because she saysBut here were arunning on this way and you haint told me a wordabout Sis nor any of them  Now Ill rest my works a little and youstart up yourn just tell me everythingtell me all about m all everyone of m and how they are and what theyre doing and what they toldyou to tell me and every last thing you can think ofWell I see I was up a stumpand up it good  Providence had

 Ill play a joke on himChildren dont you say a wordI see I was in a fix now  But it warnt no use to worry there warntnothing to do but just hold still and try and be ready to stand fromunder when the lightning struckI had just one little glimpse of the old gentleman when he come in thenthe bed hid him  Mrs Phelps she jumps for him and saysHas he comeNo says her husbandGoodness gracious she says

give MrsPhelps the chance she wanted  She stooped down quick at the foot of thebed and give me a pull and out I come and when he turned back from thewindow there she stood abeaming and asmiling like a house afire andI standing pretty meek and sweaty alongside  The old gentleman staredand saysWhy whos thatWho do you reckon t isI haint no idea  Who is itIts Tom SawyerBy jings I most slumped through the floor  But there warnt no time toswap knives the old man grabbed me by the hand and shook and kept onshaking and all the time how the woman did dance around and laugh andcry and then how they both did fire off questions about Sid and Maryand the rest of the tribeBut if they was joyful it warnt nothing to what I was for it was likebeing born again I was so glad to find out who I was  Well they frozeto me for two hours and at last when my chin was so tired it couldnthardly go any more I had told them more about my familyI mean theSawyer familythan ever happened to any six Sawyer families  And Iexplained all about how we blowed out a cylinderhead at the mouth ofWhite River and it took us three days to fix it  Which was all rightand worked firstrate because they didnt know but what it would takethree days to fix it  If Id a called it a bolthead it would a donejust as wellNow I was feeling pretty comfortable all down one side and prettyuncomfortable all up the other  Being Tom Sawyer was easy andcomfortable and it stayed easy and comfortable till by and by I hear asteamboat coughing along down the river  Then I says to myself sposeTom Sawyer comes down on that boat  And spose he steps in here anyminute and sings out my name before I can throw him a wink to keepquietWell I couldnt have it that way it wouldnt do at all  I must goup the road and waylay him  So I told the folks I reckoned I would goup to the town and fetch down my baggage  The old gentleman was forgoing along with me but I said no I could drive the horse myself andI druther he wouldnt take no trouble about meCHAPTER XXXIIISO I started for town in the wagon and when I was halfway I see awagon coming and sure enough it was Tom Sawyer and I stopped andwaited till he come along  I says Hold on and it stopped alongsideand his mouth opened up like a trunk and stayed so and he swallowedtwo or three times like a person thats got a dry throat and then saysI haint ever done you no harm  You know that  So then what youwant to come back and hant me forI saysI haint come backI haint been goneWhen he heard my voice it righted him up some but he warnt quitesatisfied yet  He saysDont you play nothing on me because I wouldnt on you  Honest injunnow you aint a ghostHonest injun I aint I saysWellIIwell that ought to settle it of course but I cant somehowseem to understand it no way  Looky here warnt you ever murdered atallNo  I warnt ever murdered at allI played it on them  You come inhere and feel of me if you dont believe meSo he done it and it satisfied him and he was that glad to see meagain he didnt know what to do  And he wanted to know all about itright off because it was a grand adventure and mysterious and so ithit him where he lived  But I said leave it alone till by and by andtold his driver to wait and we drove off a little piece and I toldhim the kind of a fix I was in and what did he reckon we better do  Hesaid let him alone a minute and dont disturb him  So he thought andthought and pretty soon he saysIts all right Ive got it  Take my trunk in your wagon and let onits yourn and you turn back and fool along slow so as to get to thehouse about the time you ought to and Ill go towards town a piece andtake a fresh start and get there a quarter or a half an hour after youand you neednt let on to know me at firstI saysAll right but wait a minute  Theres one more thinga thing thatnobody dont know but me  And that is theres a nigger here thatIm atrying to steal out of slavery and his name is Jimold MissWatsons JimHe saysWhat  Why Jim isHe stopped and went to studying  I saysI know what youll say  Youll say its dirty lowdown business butwhat if it is  Im low down and Im agoing to steal him and I wantyou keep mum and not let on  Will youHis eye lit up and he saysIll help you steal himWell I let go all holts then like I was shot  It was the mostastonishing speech I ever heardand Im bound to say Tom Sawyer fellconsiderable in my estimation  Only I couldnt believe it  Tom Sawyera niggerstealerOh shucks  I says youre jokingI aint joking eitherWell then I says joking or no joking if you hear anything saidabout a runaway nigger dont forget to remember that you dont knownothing about him and I dont know nothing about himThen we took the trunk and put it in my wagon and he drove off hisway and I drove mine  But of course I forgot all about driving slow onaccounts of being glad and full of thinking so I got home a heap tooquick for that length of a trip  The old gentleman was at the door andhe saysWhy this is wonderful  Whoever would a thought it was in that mareto do it  I wish wed a timed her  And she haint sweated a hairnota hair Its wonderful  Why I wouldnt take a hundred dollars for thathorse nowI wouldnt honest and yet Id a sold her for fifteen beforeand thought twas all she was worthThats all he said  He was the innocentest best old soul I ever seeBut it warnt surprising because he warnt only just a farmer he wasa preacher too and had a little onehorse log church down back of theplantation which he built it himself at his own expense for a churchand schoolhouse and never charged nothing for his preaching and it wasworth it too  There was plenty other farmerpreachers like that anddone the same way down SouthIn about half an hour Toms wagon drove up to the front stile and AuntSally she see it through the window because it was only about fiftyyards and saysWhy theres somebody come  I wonder who tis  Why I do believe itsa stranger  Jimmy thats one of the children run and tell Lize toput on another plate for dinnerEverybody made a rush for the front door because of course a strangerdont come every year and so he lays over the yallerfever forinterest when he does come  Tom was over the stile and starting forthe house the wagon was spinning up the road for the village and wewas all bunched in the front door  Tom had his store clothes on and anaudienceand that was always nuts for Tom Sawyer  In them circumstancesit warnt no trouble to him to throw in an amount of style that wassuitable  He warnt a boy to meeky along up that yard like a sheep nohe come cam and important like the ram  When he got afront of us helifts his hat ever so gracious and dainty like it was the lid of a boxthat had butterflies asleep in it and he didnt want to disturb themand saysMr Archibald Nichols I presumeNo my boy says the old gentleman Im sorry to say t your driverhas deceived you Nicholss place is down a matter of three mile moreCome in come inTom he took a look back over his shoulder and says Too latehes outof sightYes hes gone my son and you must come in and eat your dinner withus and then well hitch up and take you down to NicholssOh I cant make you so much trouble I couldnt think of it  IllwalkI dont mind the distanceBut we wont let you walkit wouldnt be Southern hospitality to doit Come right inOh do says Aunt Sally it aint a bit of trouble to us not abit in the world  You must stay  Its a long dusty three mile andwe cant let you walk  And besides Ive already told em to put onanother plate when I see you coming so you mustnt disappoint us  Comeright in and make yourself at homeSo Tom he thanked them very hearty and handsome and let himself bepersuaded and come in and when he was in he said he was a strangerfrom Hicksville Ohio and his name was William Thompsonand he madeanother bowWell he run on and on and on making up stuff about Hicksville andeverybody in it he could invent and I getting a little nervious andwondering how this was going to help me out of my scrape and at laststill talking along he reached over and kissed Aunt Sally right on themouth and then settled back again in his chair comfortable and wasgoing on talking but she jumped up and wiped it off with the back ofher hand and saysYou owdacious puppyHe looked kind of hurt and saysIm surprised at you mamYoure srpWhy what do you reckon I am  Ive a good notion to takeandSay what do you mean by kissing meHe looked kind of humble and saysI didnt mean nothing mam  I didnt mean no harm  IIthought youdlike itWhy you born fool  She took up the spinning stick and it lookedlike it was all she could do to keep from giving him a crack with it What made you think Id like itWell I dont know  Only theytheytold me you wouldThey told you I would  Whoever told yous another lunatic  Inever heard the beat of it  Whos theyWhy everybody  They all said so mamIt was all she could do to hold in and her eyes snapped and herfingers worked like she wanted to scratch him and she saysWhos everybody  Out with their names or therll be an idiotshortHe got up and looked distressed and fumbled his hat and saysIm sorry and I warnt expecting it  They told me to  They all toldme to  They all said kiss her and said shed like it  They all saiditevery one of them  But Im sorry mam and I wont do it no moreIwont honestYou wont wont you  Well I shd reckon you wontNom Im honest about it I wont ever do it againtill you ask meTill I ask you  Well I never see the beat of it in my born days I lay youll be the Methusalemnumskull of creation before ever I askyouor the likes of youWell he says it does surprise me so  I cant make it out somehowThey said you would and I thought you would  But He stopped andlooked around slow like he wished he could run across a friendly eyesomewheres and fetched up on the old gentlemans and says Didntyou think shed like me to kiss her sirWhy no IIwell no I blieve I didntThen he looks on around the same way to me and saysTom didnt you think Aunt Sally d open out her arms and say SidSawyerMy land she says breaking in and jumping for him you impudentyoung rascal to fool a body so and was going to hug him but hefended her off and saysNo not till youve asked me firstSo she didnt lose no time but asked him and hugged him and kissedhim over and over again and then turned him over to the old man and hetook what was left  And after they got a little quiet again she saysWhy dear me I never see such a surprise  We warnt looking for youat all but only Tom  Sis never wrote to me about anybody coming buthimIts because it warnt intended for any of us to come but Tom hesays but I begged and begged and at the last minute she let mecome too so coming down the river me and Tom thought it would be afirstrate surprise for him to come here to the house first and for meto by and by tag along and drop in and let on to be a stranger  But itwas a mistake Aunt Sally  This aint no healthy place for a strangerto comeNonot impudent whelps Sid  You ought to had your jaws boxed Ihaint been so put out since I dont know when  But I dont care Idont mind the termsId be willing to stand a thousand such jokes tohave you here Well to think of that performance  I dont deny it Iwas most putrified with astonishment when you give me that smackWe had dinner out in that broad open passage betwixt the house andthe kitchen and there was things enough on that table for sevenfamiliesand all hot too none of your flabby tough meat thats laidin a cupboard in a damp cellar all night and tastes like a hunk ofold cold cannibal in the morning  Uncle Silas he asked a pretty longblessing over it but it was worth it and it didnt cool it a bitneither the way Ive seen them kind of interruptions do lots of times There was a considerable good deal of talk all the afternoon and meand Tom was on the lookout all the time but it warnt no use theydidnt happen to say nothing about any runaway nigger and we was afraidto try to work up to it  But at supper at night one of the littleboys saysPa maynt Tom and Sid and me go to the showNo says the old man I reckon there aint going to be any and youcouldnt go if there was because the runaway nigger told Burton andme all about that scandalous show and Burton said he would tell thepeople so I reckon theyve drove the owdacious loafers out of townbefore this timeSo there it wasbut I couldnt help it  Tom and me was to sleep in thesame room and bed so being tired we bid goodnight and went up tobed right after supper and clumb out of the window and down thelightningrod and shoved for the town for I didnt believe anybody wasgoing to give the king and the duke a hint and so if I didnt hurry upand give them one theyd get into trouble sureOn the road Tom he told me all about how it was reckoned I was murderedand how pap disappeared pretty soon and didnt come back no more andwhat a stir there was when Jim run away and I told Tom all about ourRoyal Nonesuch rapscallions and as much of the raft voyage as I hadtime to and as we struck into the town and up through the the middle ofitit was as much as halfafter eight thenhere comes a raging rush ofpeople with torches and an awful whooping and yelling and banging tinpans and blowing horns and we jumped to one side to let them go byand as they went by I see they had the king and the duke astraddle of arailthat is I knowed it was the king and the duke though they wasall over tar and feathers and didnt look like nothing in theworld that was humanjust looked like a couple of monstrous bigsoldierplumes  Well it made me sick to see it and I was sorry forthem poor pitiful rascals it seemed like I couldnt ever feel anyhardness against them any more in the world  It was a dreadful thing tosee  Human beings can be awful cruel to one anotherWe see we was too latecouldnt do no good  We asked some stragglersabout it and they said everybody went to the show looking veryinnocent and laid low and kept dark till the poor old king was in themiddle of his cavortings on the stage then somebody give a signal andthe house rose up and went for themSo we poked along back home and I warnt feeling so brash as I wasbefore but kind of ornery and humble and to blame somehowthoughI hadnt done nothing  But thats always the way it dont make nodifference whether you do right or wrong a persons conscience aintgot no sense and just goes for him anyway  If I had a yaller dog thatdidnt know no more than a persons conscience does I would pison himIt takes up more room than all the rest of a persons insides and yetaint no good nohow  Tom Sawyer he says the sameCHAPTER XXXIVWE stopped talking and got to thinking  By and by Tom saysLooky here Huck what fools we are to not think of it before  I bet Iknow where Jim isNo  WhereIn that hut down by the ashhopper  Why looky here  When we was atdinner didnt you see a nigger man go in there with some vittlesYesWhat did you think the vittles was forFor a dogSo d I Well it wasnt for a dogWhyBecause part of it was watermelonSo it wasI noticed it  Well it does beat all that I never thoughtabout a dog not eating watermelon  It shows how a body can see anddont see at the same timeWell the nigger unlocked the padlock when he went in and he locked itagain when he came out  He fetched uncle a key about the time we got upfrom tablesame key I bet  Watermelon shows man lock shows prisonerand it aint likely theres two prisoners on such a little plantationand where the peoples all so kind and good  Jims the prisoner  AllrightIm glad we found it out detective fashion I wouldnt give shucksfor any other way  Now you work your mind and study out a plan tosteal Jim and I will study out one too and well take the one we likethe bestWhat a head for just a boy to have  If I had Tom Sawyers head Iwouldnt trade it off to be a duke nor mate of a steamboat nor clownin a circus nor nothing I can think of  I went to thinking out a planbut only just to be doing something I knowed very well where the rightplan was going to come from  Pretty soon Tom saysReadyYes I saysAll rightbring it outMy plan is this I says  We can easy find out if its Jim in thereThen get up my canoe tomorrow night and fetch my raft over from theisland  Then the first dark night that comes steal the key out of theold mans britches after he goes to bed and shove off down the riveron the raft with Jim hiding daytimes and running nights the way me andJim used to do before  Wouldnt that plan workWork  Why certnly it would work like rats afighting  But itstoo blame simple there aint nothing to it  Whats the good of aplan that aint no more trouble than that  Its as mild as goosemilk Why Huck it wouldnt make no more talk than breaking into a soapfactoryI never said nothing because I warnt expecting nothing different butI knowed mighty well that whenever he got his plan ready it wouldnthave none of them objections to itAnd it didnt  He told me what it was and I see in a minute it wasworth fifteen of mine for style and would make Jim just as free a manas mine would and maybe get us all killed besides  So I was satisfiedand said we would waltz in on it  I neednt tell what it was herebecause I knowed it wouldnt stay the way it was  I knowed he would bechanging it around every which way as we went along and heaving in newbullinesses wherever he got a chance  And that is what he doneWell one thing was dead sure and that was that Tom Sawyer was inearnest and was actuly going to help steal that nigger out of slaveryThat was the thing that was too many for me  Here was a boy that wasrespectable and well brung up and had a character to lose and folks athome that had characters and he was bright and not leatherheaded andknowing and not ignorant and not mean but kind and yet here he waswithout any more pride or rightness or feeling than to stoop tothis business and make himself a shame and his family a shamebefore everybody  I couldnt understand it no way at all  It wasoutrageous and I knowed I ought to just up and tell him so and so behis true friend and let him quit the thing right where he was and savehimself And I did start to tell him but he shut me up and saysDont you reckon I know what Im about  Dont I generly know what ImaboutYesDidnt I say I was going to help steal the niggerYesWell thenThats all he said and thats all I said  It warnt no use to say anymore because when he said hed do a thing he always done it  But Icouldnt make out how he was willing to go into this thing so I justlet it go and never bothered no more about it  If he was bound to haveit so I couldnt help itWhen we got home the house was all dark and still so we went on down tothe hut by the ashhopper for to examine it  We went through the yardso as to see what the hounds would do  They knowed us and didnt makeno more noise than country dogs is always doing when anything comes byin the night  When we got to the cabin we took a look at the front andthe two sides and on the side I warnt acquainted withwhich was thenorth sidewe found a square windowhole up tolerable high with justone stout board nailed across it  I saysHeres the ticket  This holes big enough for Jim to get through if wewrench off the boardTom saysIts as simple as tittattoe threeinarow and as easy asplaying hooky  I should hope we can find a way thats a little morecomplicated than that Huck FinnWell then I says how ll it do to saw him out the way I donebefore I was murdered that timeThats more like he says  Its real mysterious and troublesomeand good he says but I bet we can find a way thats twice as long There aint no hurry les keep on looking aroundBetwixt the hut and the fence on the back side was a leanto thatjoined the hut at the eaves and was made out of plank  It was as longas the hut but narrowonly about six foot wide  The door to it was atthe south end and was padlocked  Tom he went to the soapkettle andsearched around and fetched back the iron thing they lift the lid withso he took it and prized out one of the staples  The chain fell downand we opened the door and went in and shut it and struck a matchand see the shed was only built against a cabin and hadnt no connectionwith it and there warnt no floor to the shed nor nothing in it butsome old rusty playedout hoes and spades and picks and a crippled plow The match went out and so did we and shoved in the staple again andthe door was locked as good as ever Tom was joyful  He saysNow were all right  Well dig him out  It ll take about a weekThen we started for the house and I went in the back dooryou only haveto pull a buckskin latchstring they dont fasten the doorsbut thatwarnt romantical enough for Tom Sawyer no way would do him but he mustclimb up the lightningrod  But after he got up half way about threetimes and missed fire and fell every time and the last time mostbusted his brains out he thought hed got to give it up but after hewas rested he allowed he would give her one more turn for luck and thistime he made the tripIn the morning we was up at break of day and down to the nigger cabinsto pet the dogs and make friends with the nigger that fed Jimif itwas Jim that was being fed  The niggers was just getting throughbreakfast and starting for the fields and Jims nigger was piling upa tin pan with bread and meat and things and whilst the others wasleaving the key come from the houseThis nigger had a goodnatured chuckleheaded face and his wool wasall tied up in little bunches with thread  That was to keep witchesoff  He said the witches was pestering him awful these nights andmaking him see all kinds of strange things and hear all kinds ofstrange words and noises and he didnt believe he was ever witched solong before in his life  He got so worked up and got to running on soabout his troubles he forgot all about what hed been agoing to do So Tom saysWhats the vittles for  Going to feed the dogsThe nigger kind of smiled around gradually over his face like when youheave a brickbat in a mudpuddle and he saysYes Mars Sid A dog  Curus dog too  Does you want to go en look atimYesI hunched Tom and whispersYou going right here in the daybreak  that warnt the planNo it warnt but its the plan nowSo drat him we went along but I didnt like it much  When we got inwe couldnt hardly see anything it was so dark but Jim was there sureenough and could see us and he sings outWhy Huck  En good lan ain dat Misto TomI just knowed how it would be I just expected it  I didnt knownothing to do and if I had I couldnt a done it because that niggerbusted in and saysWhy de gracious sakes do he know you genlmenWe could see pretty well now  Tom he looked at the nigger steady andkind of wondering and saysDoes who know usWhy disyer runaway niggerI dont reckon he does but what put that into your headWhat put it dar  Didn he jis dis minute sing out like he knowedyouTom says in a puzzledup kind of wayWell thats mighty curious  Who sung out when did he sing out what did he sing out And turns to me perfectly cam and saysDid you hear anybody sing outOf course there warnt nothing to be said but the one thing so I saysNo I aint heard nobody say nothingThen he turns to Jim and looks him over like he never see him beforeand saysDid you sing outNo sah says Jim I haint said nothing sahNot a wordNo sah I haint said a wordDid you ever see us beforeNo sah not as I knows onSo Tom turns to the nigger which was looking wild and distressed andsays kind of severeWhat do you reckons the matter with you anyway  What made you thinksomebody sung outOh its de dadblame witches sah en I wisht I was dead I do Deys awluz at it sah en dey do mos kill me dey skyers me so Please to dont tell nobody bout it sah er ole Mars Silas hell scoleme kase he say dey aint no witches  I jis wish to goodness he washeah nowden what would he say  I jis bet he couldn fine no way togit aroun it dis time  But its awluz jis so people dats sotstays sot dey wont look into nothnen fine it out fr deyselves enwhen you fine it out en tell um bout it dey doan blieve youTom give him a dime and said we wouldnt tell nobody and told him tobuy some more thread to tie up his wool with and then looks at Jim andsaysI wonder if Uncle Silas is going to hang this nigger  If I was tocatch a nigger that was ungrateful enough to run away I wouldnt givehim up Id hang him  And whilst the nigger stepped to the door tolook at the dime and bite it to see if it was good he whispers to Jimand saysDont ever let on to know us  And if you hear any digging going onnights its us were going to set you freeJim only had time to grab us by the hand and squeeze it then the niggercome back and we said wed come again some time if the nigger wantedus to and he said he would more particular if it was dark because thewitches went for him mostly in the dark and it was good to have folksaround thenCHAPTER XXXVIT would be most an hour yet till breakfast so we left and struck downinto the woods because Tom said we got to have some light to see howto dig by and a lantern makes too much and might get us into troublewhat we must have was a lot of them rotten chunks thats calledfoxfire and just makes a soft kind of a glow when you lay them in adark place  We fetched an armful and hid it in the weeds and set downto rest and Tom says kind of dissatisfiedBlame it this whole thing is just as easy and awkward as it can beAnd so it makes it so rotten difficult to get up a difficult plan There aint no watchman to be druggednow there ought to be awatchman  There aint even a dog to give a sleepingmixture to  Andtheres Jim chained by one leg with a tenfoot chain to the leg of hisbed  why all you got to do is to lift up the bedstead and slip offthe chain  And Uncle Silas he trusts everybody sends the key to thepunkinheaded nigger and dont send nobody to watch the nigger  Jimcould a got out of that windowhole before this only there wouldnt beno use trying to travel with a tenfoot chain on his leg  Why drat itHuck its the stupidest arrangement I ever see You got to invent allthe difficulties  Well we cant help it we got to do the best we canwith the materials weve got Anyhow theres one thingtheres morehonor in getting him out through a lot of difficulties and dangerswhere there warnt one of them furnished to you by the people who it wastheir duty to furnish them and you had to contrive them all out of yourown head  Now look at just that one thing of the lantern  When youcome down to the cold facts we simply got to let on that a lanternsresky  Why we could work with a torchlight procession if we wanted toI believe  Now whilst I think of it we got to hunt up something tomake a saw out of the first chance we getWhat do we want of a sawWhat do we want of it  Haint we got to saw the leg of Jims bedoff so as to get the chain looseWhy you just said a body could lift up the bedstead and slip the chainoffWell if that aint just like you Huck Finn  You can get up theinfantschooliest ways of going at a thing  Why haint you ever readany books at allBaron Trenck nor Casanova nor Benvenuto Chelleenynor Henri IV nor none of them heroes  Who ever heard of getting aprisoner loose in such an oldmaidy way as that  No the way all thebest authorities does is to saw the bedleg in two and leave it justso and swallow the sawdust so it cant be found and put some dirt andgrease around the sawed place so the very keenest seneskal cant seeno sign of its being sawed and thinks the bedleg is perfectly soundThen the night youre ready fetch the leg a kick down she goes slipoff your chain and there you are  Nothing to do but hitch yourrope ladder to the battlements shin down it break your leg in themoatbecause a rope ladder is nineteen foot too short you knowandtheres your horses and your trusty vassles and they scoop you up andfling you across a saddle and away you go to your native Langudoc orNavarre or wherever it is Its gaudy Huck  I wish there was a moatto this cabin If we get time the night of the escape well dig oneI saysWhat do we want of a moat when were going to snake him out from underthe cabinBut he never heard me  He had forgot me and everything else  He hadhis chin in his hand thinking  Pretty soon he sighs and shakes hishead then sighs again and saysNo it wouldnt dothere aint necessity enough for itFor what  I saysWhy to saw Jims leg off he saysGood land  I says why there aint no necessity for it  And whatwould you want to saw his leg off for anywayWell some of the best authorities has done it  They couldnt get thechain off so they just cut their hand off and shoved  And a leg wouldbe better still  But we got to let that go  There aint necessityenough in this case and besides Jims a nigger and wouldntunderstand the reasons for it and how its the custom in Europe sowell let it go  But theres one thinghe can have a rope ladder wecan tear up our sheets and make him a rope ladder easy enough  And wecan send it to him in a pie its mostly done that way  And Ive etworse piesWhy Tom Sawyer how you talk I says Jim aint got no use for arope ladderHe has got use for it  How you talk you better say you dontknow nothing about it  Hes got to have a rope ladder they all doWhat in the nation can he do with itDo with it  He can hide it in his bed cant he  Thats what theyall do and hes got to too  Huck you dont ever seem to want to doanything thats regular you want to be starting something fresh all thetime Spose he dont do nothing with it aint it there in his bedfor a clew after hes gone and dont you reckon theyll want clews Of course they will  And you wouldnt leave them any  That would be apretty howdydo wouldnt it  I never heard of such a thingWell I says if its in the regulations and hes got to haveit all right let him have it because I dont wish to go back on noregulations but theres one thing Tom Sawyerif we go to tearing upour sheets to make Jim a rope ladder were going to get into troublewith Aunt Sally just as sure as youre born  Now the way I look atit a hickrybark ladder dont cost nothing and dont waste nothingand is just as good to load up a pie with and hide in a straw tickas any rag ladder you can start and as for Jim he aint had noexperience and so he dont care what kind of aOh shucks Huck Finn if I was as ignorant as you Id keepstillthats what ID do  Who ever heard of a state prisoner escapingby a hickrybark ladder  Why its perfectly ridiculousWell all right Tom fix it your own way but if youll take myadvice youll let me borrow a sheet off of the clotheslineHe said that would do  And that gave him another idea and he saysBorrow a shirt tooWhat do we want of a shirt TomWant it for Jim to keep a journal onJournal your grannyJim cant writeSpose he cant writehe can make marks on the shirt cant he ifwe make him a pen out of an old pewter spoon or a piece of an old ironbarrelhoopWhy Tom we can pull a feather out of a goose and make him a betterone and quicker tooPrisoners dont have geese running around the donjonkeep to pullpens out of you muggins  They always make their pens out of thehardest toughest troublesomest piece of old brass candlestick orsomething like that they can get their hands on and it takes them weeksand weeks and months and months to file it out too because theyve gotto do it by rubbing it on the wall  They wouldnt use a goosequillif they had it It aint regularWell then whatll we make him the ink out ofMany makes it out of ironrust and tears but thats the common sortand women the best authorities uses their own blood  Jim can do thatand when he wants to send any little common ordinary mysterious messageto let the world know where hes captivated he can write it on thebottom of a tin plate with a fork and throw it out of the window  TheIron Mask always done that and its a blame good way tooJim aint got no tin plates  They feed him in a panThat aint nothing we can get him someCant nobody read his platesThat aint got anything to do with it Huck Finn  All hes got todo is to write on the plate and throw it out  You dont have to beable to read it Why half the time you cant read anything a prisonerwrites on a tin plate or anywhere elseWell then whats the sense in wasting the platesWhy blame it all it aint the prisoners platesBut its somebodys plates aint itWell sposn it is  What does the prisoner care whoseHe broke off there because we heard the breakfasthorn blowing  So wecleared out for the houseAlong during the morning I borrowed a sheet and a white shirt off of theclothesline and I found an old sack and put them in it and we wentdown and got the foxfire and put that in too  I called it borrowingbecause that was what pap always called it but Tom said it warntborrowing it was stealing  He said we was representing prisoners andprisoners dont care how they get a thing so they get it and nobodydont blame them for it either  It aint no crime in a prisoner tosteal the thing he needs to get away with Tom said its his right andso as long as we was representing a prisoner we had a perfect right tosteal anything on this place we had the least use for to get ourselvesout of prison with  He said if we warnt prisoners it would be a verydifferent thing and nobody but a mean ornery person would steal whenhe warnt a prisoner  So we allowed we would steal everything there wasthat come handy  And yet he made a mighty fuss one day after thatwhen I stole a watermelon out of the niggerpatch and eat it and hemade me go and give the niggers a dime without telling them what itwas for Tom said that what he meant was we could steal anything weneeded Well I says I needed the watermelon  But he said I didntneed it to get out of prison with theres where the difference was He said if Id a wanted it to hide a knife in and smuggle it to Jimto kill the seneskal with it would a been all right  So I let it go atthat though I couldnt see no advantage in my representing a prisonerif I got to set down and chaw over a lot of goldleaf distinctions likethat every time I see a chance to hog a watermelonWell as I was saying we waited that morning till everybody was settleddown to business and nobody in sight around the yard then Tom hecarried the sack into the leanto whilst I stood off a piece to keepwatch  By and by he come out and we went and set down on the woodpileto talk  He saysEverythings all right now except tools and thats easy fixedTools  I saysYesTools for whatWhy to dig with  We aint agoing to gnaw him out are weAint them old crippled picks and things in there good enough to dig anigger out with  I saysHe turns on me looking pitying enough to make a body cry and saysHuck Finn did you ever hear of a prisoner having picks and shovelsand all the modern conveniences in his wardrobe to dig himself out with Now I want to ask youif you got any reasonableness in you at allwhatkind of a show would that give him to be a hero  Why they might aswell lend him the key and done with it  Picks and shovelswhy theywouldnt furnish em to a kingWell then I says if we dont want the picks and shovels what dowe wantA couple of caseknivesTo dig the foundations out from under that cabin withYesConfound it its foolish TomIt dont make no difference how foolish it is its the right wayandits the regular way  And there aint no other way that ever I heardof and Ive read all the books that gives any information about thesethings They always dig out with a caseknifeand not through dirt mindyou generly its through solid rock  And it takes them weeks and weeksand weeks and for ever and ever  Why look at one of them prisoners inthe bottom dungeon of the Castle Deef in the harbor of Marseilles thatdug himself out that way how long was he at it you reckonI dont knowWell guessI dont know  A month and a halfThirtyseven yearand he come out in China  Thats the kind  Iwish the bottom of this fortress was solid rockJim dont know nobody in ChinaWhats that got to do with it  Neither did that other fellow  Butyoure always awandering off on a side issue  Why cant you stick tothe main pointAll rightI dont care where he comes out so he comes out and Jimdont either I reckon  But theres one thing anywayJims too old tobe dug out with a caseknife  He wont lastYes he will last too  You dont reckon its going to takethirtyseven years to dig out through a dirt foundation do youHow long will it take TomWell we cant resk being as long as we ought to because it maynttake very long for Uncle Silas to hear from down there by New Orleans Hell hear Jim aint from there  Then his next move will be toadvertise Jim or something like that  So we cant resk being as longdigging him out as we ought to  By rights I reckon we ought to bea couple of years but we cant  Things being so uncertain what Irecommend is this  that we really dig right in as quick as we canand after that we can let on to ourselves that we was at itthirtyseven years  Then we can snatch him out and rush him away thefirst time theres an alarm  Yes I reckon that ll be the best wayNow theres sense in that I says  Letting on dont cost nothingletting on aint no trouble and if its any object I dont mindletting on we was at it a hundred and fifty year  It wouldnt strainme none after I got my hand in  So Ill mosey along now and smouch acouple of caseknivesSmouch three he says we want one to make a saw out ofTom if it aint unregular and irreligious to sejest it I saystheres an old rusty sawblade around yonder sticking under theweatherboarding behind the smokehouseHe looked kind of weary and discouragedlike and saysIt aint no use to try to learn you nothing Huck  Run along andsmouch the knivesthree of them  So I done itCHAPTER XXXVIAS soon as we reckoned everybody was asleep that night we went down thelightningrod and shut ourselves up in the leanto and got out ourpile of foxfire and went to work  We cleared everything out of theway about four or five foot along the middle of the bottom log  Tomsaid he was right behind Jims bed now and wed dig in under it andwhen we got through there couldnt nobody in the cabin ever know therewas any hole there because Jims counterpin hung down most to theground and youd have to raise it up and look under to see the hole So we dug and dug with the caseknives till most midnight and thenwe was dogtired and our hands was blistered and yet you couldnt seewed done anything hardly  At last I saysThis aint no thirtyseven year job this is a thirtyeight year jobTom SawyerHe never said nothing  But he sighed and pretty soon he stoppeddigging and then for a good little while I knowed that he was thinkingThen he saysIt aint no use Huck it aint agoing to work  If we was prisonersit would because then wed have as many years as we wanted and nohurry and we wouldnt get but a few minutes to dig every day whilethey was changing watches and so our hands wouldnt get blistered andwe could keep it up right along year in and year out and do it rightand the way it ought to be done  But we cant fool along we got torush we aint got no time to spare  If we was to put in anothernight this way wed have to knock off for a week to let our hands getwellcouldnt touch a caseknife with them soonerWell then what we going to do TomIll tell you  It aint right and it aint moral and I wouldnt likeit to get out but there aint only just the one way  we got to dig himout with the picks and let on its caseknivesNow youre talking  I says your head gets leveler and levelerall the time Tom Sawyer I says  Picks is the thing moral or nomoral and as for me I dont care shucks for the morality of it nohow When I start in to steal a nigger or a watermelon or a Sundayschoolbook I aint no ways particular how its done so its done  What Iwant is my nigger or what I want is my watermelon or what I want is mySundayschool book and if a picks the handiest thing thats the thingIm agoing to dig that nigger or that watermelon or that Sundayschoolbook out with and I dont give a dead rat what the authorities thinksabout it nutherWell he says theres excuse for picks and lettingon in a case likethis if it warnt so I wouldnt approve of it nor I wouldnt stand byand see the rules brokebecause right is right and wrong is wrongand a body aint got no business doing wrong when he aint ignorant andknows better  It might answer for you to dig Jim out with a pickwithout any letting on because you dont know no better but itwouldnt for me because I do know better  Gimme a caseknifeHe had his own by him but I handed him mine  He flung it down andsaysGimme a caseknifeI didnt know just what to dobut then I thought  I scratched aroundamongst the old tools and got a pickaxe and give it to him and he tookit and went to work and never said a wordHe was always just that particular  Full of principleSo then I got a shovel and then we picked and shoveled turn aboutand made the fur fly  We stuck to it about a half an hour which was aslong as we could stand up but we had a good deal of a hole to show forit When I got up stairs I looked out at the window and see Tom doinghis level best with the lightningrod but he couldnt come it hishands was so sore  At last he saysIt aint no use it cant be done  What you reckon I better do  Cantyou think of no wayYes I says but I reckon it aint regular  Come up the stairs andlet on its a lightningrodSo he done itNext day Tom stole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick in the housefor to make some pens for Jim out of and six tallow candles and Ihung around the nigger cabins and laid for a chance and stole three tinplates  Tom says it wasnt enough but I said nobody wouldnt ever seethe plates that Jim throwed out because theyd fall in the dogfenneland jimpson weeds under the windowholethen we could tote them back andhe could use them over again  So Tom was satisfied  Then he saysNow the thing to study out is how to get the things to JimTake them in through the hole I says when we get it doneHe only just looked scornful and said something about nobody ever heardof such an idiotic idea and then he went to studying  By and by hesaid he had ciphered out two or three ways but there warnt no need todecide on any of them yet  Said wed got to post Jim firstThat night we went down the lightningrod a little after ten and tookone of the candles along and listened under the windowhole and heardJim snoring so we pitched it in and it didnt wake him  Then wewhirled in with the pick and shovel and in about two hours and a halfthe job was done  We crept in under Jims bed and into the cabin andpawed around and found the candle and lit it and stood over Jim awhileand found him looking hearty and healthy and then we woke him up gentleand gradual  He was so glad to see us he most cried and called ushoney and all the pet names he could think of and was for having ushunt up a coldchisel to cut the chain off of his leg with right awayand clearing out without losing any time  But Tom he showed him howunregular it would be and set down and told him all about our plansand how we could alter them in a minute any time there was an alarm andnot to be the least afraid because we would see he got away sure So Jim he said it was all right and we set there and talked over oldtimes awhile and then Tom asked a lot of questions and when Jim toldhim Uncle Silas come in every day or two to pray with him and AuntSally come in to see if he was comfortable and had plenty to eat andboth of them was kind as they could be Tom saysNow I know how to fix it  Well send you some things by themI said Dont do nothing of the kind its one of the most jackassideas I ever struck but he never paid no attention to me went righton  It was his way when hed got his plans setSo he told Jim how wed have to smuggle in the ropeladder pie and otherlarge things by Nat the nigger that fed him and he must be on thelookout and not be surprised and not let Nat see him open them andwe would put small things in uncles coatpockets and he must steal themout and we would tie things to aunts apronstrings or put them in herapronpocket if we got a chance and told him what they would be andwhat they was for  And told him how to keep a journal on the shirt withhis blood and all that He told him everything  Jim he couldnt seeno sense in the most of it but he allowed we was white folks and knowedbetter than him so he was satisfied and said he would do it all justas Tom saidJim had plenty corncob pipes and tobacco so we had a right down goodsociable time then we crawled out through the hole and so home tobed with hands that looked like theyd been chawed  Tom was in highspirits He said it was the best fun he ever had in his life and themost intellectural and said if he only could see his way to it we wouldkeep it up all the rest of our lives and leave Jim to our children toget out for he believed Jim would come to like it better and better themore he got used to it  He said that in that way it could be strung outto as much as eighty year and would be the best time on record  And hesaid it would make us all celebrated that had a hand in itIn the morning we went out to the woodpile and chopped up the brasscandlestick into handy sizes and Tom put them and the pewter spoon inhis pocket  Then we went to the nigger cabins and while I got Natsnotice off Tom shoved a piece of candlestick into the middle of acornpone that was in Jims pan and we went along with Nat to see howit would work and it just worked noble when Jim bit into it it mostmashed all his teeth out and there warnt ever anything could a workedbetter Tom said so himself Jim he never let on but what it was onlyjust a piece of rock or something like that thats always getting intobread you know but after that he never bit into nothing but what hejabbed his fork into it in three or four places firstAnd whilst we was astanding there in the dimmish light here comes acouple of the hounds bulging in from under Jims bed and they kept onpiling in till there was eleven of them and there warnt hardly roomin there to get your breath  By jings we forgot to fasten that leantodoor  The nigger Nat he only just hollered Witches once and keeledover on to the floor amongst the dogs and begun to groan like he wasdying  Tom jerked the door open and flung out a slab of Jims meatand the dogs went for it and in two seconds he was out himself and backagain and shut the door and I knowed hed fixed the other door tooThen he went to work on the nigger coaxing him and petting him andasking him if hed been imagining he saw something again  He raised upand blinked his eyes around and saysMars Sid youll say Is a fool but if I didnt blieve I see most amillion dogs er devils er somen I wisht I may die right heah in desetracks  I did mos sholy  Mars Sid I felt umI felt um sah deywas all over me  Dad fetch it I jis wisht I could git my hans on oneer dem witches jis wunstony

such truck and scratchedaround and found an old tin washpan and stopped up the holes as well aswe could to bake the pie in and took it down cellar and stole it fullof flour and started for breakfast and found a couple of shinglenailsthat Tom said would be handy for a prisoner to scrabble his name andsorrows on the dungeon walls with and dropped one of them in AuntSallys apronpocket which was hanging on a chair and tother we stuckin the band of Uncle Silass hat which was on the bureau because weheard the children say their pa and ma was going to the runaway niggershouse this morning and then went to breakfast and Tom dropped thepewter spoon in Uncle Silass coatpocket and Aunt Sally wasnt comeyet so we had to wait a little whileAnd when she come she was hot and red and cross and couldnt hardlywait for the blessing and then she went to sluicing out coffee with onehand and cracking the handiest childs head with her thimble with theother and saysIve hunted high and Ive hunted low and it does beat all what hasbecome of your other shirtMy heart fell down amongst my lungs and livers and things and a hardpiece of corncrust started down my throat after it and got met on theroad with a cough and was shot across the table and took one of thechildren in the eye and curled him up like a fishingworm and let a cryout of him the size of a warwhoop and Tom he turned kinder blue aroundthe gills and it all amounted to a considerable state of things forabout a quarter of a minute or as much as that and I would a sold outfor half price if there was a bidder  But after that we was all rightagainit was the sudden surprise of it that knocked us so kind of coldUncle Silas he saysIts most uncommon curious I cant understand it  I know perfectlywell I took it off becauseBecause you haint got but one on  Just listen at the man  I knowyou took it off and know it by a better way than your woolgetheringmemory too because it was on the closline yesterdayI see it theremyself But its gone thats the long and the short of it and youlljust have to change to a red flannl one till I can get time to make anew one And it ll be the third Ive made in two years  It just keepsa body on the jump to keep you in shirts and whatever you do manage todo with m all is moren I can make out  A body d think you wouldlearn to take some sort of care of em at your time of lifeI know it Sally and I do try all I can  But it oughtnt to bealtogether my fault because you know I dont see them nor havenothing to do with them except when theyre on me and I dont believeIve ever lost one of them off of meWell it aint your fault if you havent Silas youd a done itif you could I reckon  And the shirt aint all thats gone nuther Thers a spoon gone and that aint all  There was ten and nowthers only nine The calf got the shirt I reckon but the calf nevertook the spoon thats certainWhy what else is gone SallyThers six candles gonethats what  The rats could a got thecandles and I reckon they did I wonder they dont walk off with thewhole place the way youre always going to stop their holes and dontdo it and if they warnt fools theyd sleep in your hair Silasyoudnever find it out but you cant lay the spoon on the rats and that IknowWell Sally Im in fault and I acknowledge it Ive been remiss butI wont let tomorrow go by without stopping up them holesOh I wouldnt hurry next year ll do  Matilda Angelina AramintaPhelpsWhack comes the thimble and the child snatches her claws out of thesugarbowl without fooling around any  Just then the nigger woman stepson to the passage and saysMissus deys a sheet goneA sheet gone  Well for the lands sakeIll stop up them holes today says Uncle Silas looking sorrowfulOh do shet upspose the rats took the sheet  wheres it goneLizeClah to goodness I haint no notion Miss Sally  She wuz on declosline yistiddy but she done gone  she ain dah no mo nowI reckon the world is coming to an end  I never see the beat of itin all my born days  A shirt and a sheet and a spoon and six canMissus comes a young yaller wench deys a brass cannelstickmissnCler out from here you hussy er Ill take a skillet to yeWell she was just abiling  I begun to lay for a chance I reckonedI would sneak out and go for the woods till the weather moderated  Shekept araging right along running her insurrection all by herself andeverybody else mighty meek and quiet and at last Uncle Silas lookingkind of foolish fishes up that spoon out of his pocket  She stoppedwith her mouth open and her hands up and as for me I wished I was inJeruslem or somewheres But not long because she saysIts just as I expected  So you had it in your pocket all the timeand like as not youve got the other things there too  Howd it getthereI reely dont know Sally he says kind of apologizing or you knowI would tell  I was astudying over my text in Acts Seventeen beforebreakfast and I reckon I put it in there not noticing meaning to putmy Testament in and it must be so because my Testament aint in butIll go and see and if the Testament is where I had it Ill know Ididnt put it in and that will show that I laid the Testament down andtook up the spoon andOh for the lands sake  Give a body a rest  Go long now the wholekit and biling of ye and dont come nigh me again till Ive got back mypeace of mindID a heard her if shed a said it to herself let alone speaking itout and Id a got up and obeyed her if Id a been dead  As we waspassing through the settingroom the old man he took up his hat and theshinglenail fell out on the floor and he just merely picked it up andlaid it on the mantelshelf and never said nothing and went out  Tomsee him do it and remembered about the spoon and saysWell it aint no use to send things by him no more he aintreliable Then he says  But he done us a good turn with the spoonanyway without knowing it and so well go and do him one without himknowing itstop up his ratholesThere was a noble good lot of them down cellar and it took us a wholehour but we done the job tight and good and shipshape  Then we heardsteps on the stairs and blowed out our light and hid and here comesthe old man with a candle in one hand and a bundle of stuff in totherlooking as absentminded as year before last  He went a mooning aroundfirst to one rathole and then another till hed been to them all Then he stood about five minutes picking tallowdrip off of his candleand thinking  Then he turns off slow and dreamy towards the stairssayingWell for the life of me I cant remember when I done it  I couldshow her now that I warnt to blame on account of the rats  But nevermindlet it go  I reckon it wouldnt do no goodAnd so he went on amumbling up stairs and then we left  He was amighty nice old man  And always isTom was a good deal bothered about what to do for a spoon but he saidwed got to have it so he took a think  When he had ciphered it outhe told me how we was to do then we went and waited around thespoonbasket till we see Aunt Sally coming and then Tom went tocounting the spoons and laying them out to one side and I slid one ofthem up my sleeve and Tom saysWhy Aunt Sally there aint but nine spoons yetShe saysGo long to your play and dont bother me  I know better I countedm myselfWell Ive counted them twice Aunty and I cant make but nineShe looked out of all patience but of course she come to countanybodywouldI declare to gracious ther aint but nine she says  Why what inthe worldplague take the things Ill count m againSo I slipped back the one I had and when she got done counting shesaysHang the troublesome rubbage thers ten now and she looked huffyand bothered both  But Tom saysWhy Aunty I dont think theres tenYou numskull didnt you see me count mI know butWell Ill count m againSo I smouched one and they come out nine same as the other time Well she was in a tearing wayjust atrembling all over she was somad  But she counted and counted till she got that addled shed startto count in the basket for a spoon sometimes and so three times theycome out right and three times they come out wrong  Then she grabbedup the basket and slammed it across the house and knocked the catgalleywest and she said cler out and let her have some peace and ifwe come bothering around her again betwixt that and dinner shed skinus  So we had the odd spoon and dropped it in her apronpocket whilstshe was agiving us our sailing orders and Jim got it all right alongwith her shingle nail before noon  We was very well satisfied withthis business and Tom allowed it was worth twice the trouble it tookbecause he said now she couldnt ever count them spoons twice alikeagain to save her life and wouldnt believe shed counted them right ifshe did and said that after shed about counted her head off for thenext three days he judged shed give it up and offer to kill anybodythat wanted her to ever count them any moreSo we put the sheet back on the line that night and stole one out ofher closet and kept on putting it back and stealing it again for acouple of days till she didnt know how many sheets she had any moreand she didnt care and warnt agoing to bullyrag the rest of hersoul out about it and wouldnt count them again not to save her lifeshe druther die firstSo we was all right now as to the shirt and the sheet and the spoonand the candles by the help of the calf and the rats and the mixedupcounting and as to the candlestick it warnt no consequence it wouldblow over by and byBut that pie was a job we had no end of trouble with that pie  Wefixed it up away down in the woods and cooked it there and we got itdone at last and very satisfactory too but not all in one day and wehad to use up three washpans full of flour before we got through andwe got burnt pretty much all over in places and eyes put out withthe smoke because you see we didnt want nothing but a crust and wecouldnt prop it up right and she would always cave in  But of coursewe thought of the right way at lastwhich was to cook the ladder tooin the pie  So then we laid in with Jim the second night and toreup the sheet all in little strings and twisted them together and longbefore daylight we had a lovely rope that you could a hung a personwith  We let on it took nine months to make itAnd in the forenoon we took it down to the woods but it wouldnt gointo the pie  Being made of a whole sheet that way there was ropeenough for forty pies if wed a wanted them and plenty left overfor soup or sausage or anything you choose  We could a had a wholedinnerBut we didnt need it  All we needed was just enough for the pie andso we throwed the rest away  We didnt cook none of the pies in thewashpanafraid the solder would melt but Uncle Silas he had a noblebrass warmingpan which he thought considerable of because it belongedto one of his ancesters with a long wooden handle that come over fromEngland with William the Conqueror in the Mayflower or one of them earlyships and was hid away up garret with a lot of other old pots and thingsthat was valuable not on account of being any account because theywarnt but on account of them being relicts you know and we snakedher out private and took her down there but she failed on the firstpies because we didnt know how but she come up smiling on the lastone  We took and lined her with dough and set her in the coals andloaded her up with rag rope and put on a dough roof and shut down thelid and put hot embers on top and stood off five foot with the longhandle cool and comfortable and in fifteen minutes she turned out apie that was a satisfaction to look at But the person that et it wouldwant to fetch a couple of kags of toothpicks along for if that ropeladder wouldnt cramp him down to business I dont know nothing what Imtalking about and lay him in enough stomachache to last him till nexttime tooNat didnt look when we put the witch pie in Jims pan and we put thethree tin plates in the bottom of the pan under the vittles and so Jimgot everything all right and as soon as he was by himself he bustedinto the pie and hid the rope ladder inside of his straw tickand scratched some marks on a tin plate and throwed it out of thewindowholeCHAPTER XXXVIIIMAKING them pens was a distressid tough job and so was the saw and Jimallowed the inscription was going to be the toughest of all  Thats theone which the prisoner has to scrabble on the wall  But he had to haveit Tom said hed got to there warnt no case of a state prisoner notscrabbling his inscription to leave behind and his coat of armsLook at Lady Jane Grey he says look at Gilford Dudley look at oldNorthumberland  Why Huck spose it is considerble troublewhatyou going to dohow you going to get around it  Jims got to do hisinscription and coat of arms  They all doJim saysWhy Mars Tom I haint got no coat o arm I haint got nuffn but dishyer ole shirt en you knows I got to keep de journal on datOh you dont understand Jim a coat of arms is very differentWell I says Jims right anyway when he says he aint got no coatof arms because he haintI reckon I knowed that Tom says but you bet hell have one beforehe goes out of thisbecause hes going out right and there aintgoing to be no flaws in his recordSo whilst me and Jim filed away at the pens on a brickbat apiece Jimamaking hisn out of the brass and I making mine out of the spoonTom set to work to think out the coat of arms  By and by he said hedstruck so many good ones he didnt hardly know which to take but therewas one which he reckoned hed decide on  He saysOn the scutcheon well have a bend or in the dexter base a saltiremurrey in the fess with a

dancette indented crest a runaway niggersable with his bundle over his shoulder on a bar sinister and acouple of gules for supporters which is you and me motto MaggioreFretta Minore Otto  Got it out of a bookmeans the more haste theless speedGeewhillikins I says but what does the rest of it meanWe aint got no time to bother over that he says we got to dig inlike all gitoutWell anyway I says whats some of it  Whats a fessA fessa fess isyou dont need to know what a fess is  Ill showhim how to make it when he gets to itShucks Tom I says I think you might tell a person  Whats a barsinisterOh I dont know  But hes got to have it  All the nobility doesThat was just his way  If it didnt suit him to explain a thing to youhe wouldnt do it  You might pump at him a week it wouldnt make nodifferenceHed got all that coat of arms business fixed so now he started in tofinish up the rest of that part of the work which was to plan out amournful inscriptionsaid Jim got to have one like they all done  Hemade up a lot and wrote them out on a paper and read them off so1  Here a captive heart busted 2  Here a poor prisoner forsook bythe world and friends fretted his sorrowful life 3  Here a lonelyheart broke and a worn spirit went to its rest after thirtysevenyears of solitary captivity 4  Here homeless and friendless afterthirtyseven years of bitter captivity perished a noble strangernatural son of Louis XIVToms voice trembled whilst he was reading them and he most broke downWhen he got done he couldnt no way make up his mind which one for Jimto scrabble on to the wall they was all so good but at last he allowedhe would let him scrabble them all on  Jim said it would take him ayear to scrabble such a lot of truck on to the logs with a nail and hedidnt know how to make letters besides but Tom said he would blockthem out for him and then he wouldnt have nothing to do but justfollow the lines  Then pretty soon he saysCome to think the logs aint agoing to do they dont have log wallsin a dungeon  we got to dig the inscriptions into a rock  Well fetcha rockJim said the rock was worse than the logs he said it would take himsuch a pison long time to dig them into a rock he wouldnt ever get out But Tom said he would let me help him do it  Then he took a look tosee how me and Jim was getting along with the pens  It was most peskytedious hard work and slow and didnt give my hands no show to getwell of the sores and we didnt seem to make no headway hardly so TomsaysI know how to fix it  We got to have a rock for the coat of arms andmournful inscriptions and we can kill two birds with that same rockTheres a gaudy big grindstone down at the mill and well smouch itand carve the things on it and file out the pens and the saw on ittooIt warnt no slouch of an idea and it warnt no slouch of a grindstonenuther but we allowed wed tackle it  It warnt quite midnight yetso we cleared out for the mill leaving Jim at work  We smouched thegrindstone and set out to roll her home but it was a most nation toughjob Sometimes do what we could we couldnt keep her from fallingover and she come mighty near mashing us every time  Tom said she wasgoing to get one of us sure before we got through  We got her halfway and then we was plumb played out and most drownded with sweat  Wesee it warnt no use we got to go and fetch Jim So he raised up hisbed and slid the chain off of the bedleg and wrapt it round and roundhis neck and we crawled out through our hole and down there and Jimand me laid into that grindstone and walked her along like nothing andTom superintended  He could outsuperintend any boy I ever see  Heknowed how to do everythingOur hole was pretty big but it warnt big enough to get the grindstonethrough but Jim he took the pick and soon made it big enough  Then Tommarked out them things on it with the nail and set Jim to work on themwith the nail for a chisel and an iron bolt from the rubbage in theleanto for a hammer and told him to work till the rest of his candlequit on him and then he could go to bed and hide the grindstone underhis straw tick and sleep on it  Then we helped him fix his chain backon the bedleg and was ready for bed ourselves  But Tom thought ofsomething and saysYou got any spiders in here JimNo sah thanks to goodness I haint Mars TomAll right well get you someBut bless you honey I doan want none  Is afeard un um

would go to the nigger cabins and drop one private in Jimscoffeepot in the morning Jim said he would jis s soon havetobacker in his coffee and found so much fault with it and with thework and bother of raising the mullen and jewsharping the rats andpetting and flattering up the snakes and spiders and things on top ofall the other work he had to do on pens and inscriptions and journalsand things which made it more trouble and worry and responsibility tobe a prisoner than anything he ever undertook that Tom most lost allpatience with him and said he was just loadened down with more gaudierchances than a prisoner ever had in the world to make a name forhimself and yet he didnt know enough to appreciate them and they wasjust about wasted on him  So Jim he was sorry and said he wouldntbehave so no more and then me and Tom shoved for bedCHAPTER XXXIXIN the morning we went up to the village and bought a wire rattrap andfetched it down and unstopped the best rathole and in about an hourwe had fifteen of the bulliest kind of ones and then we took it and putit in a safe place under Aunt Sallys bed  But while we was gone forspiders little Thomas Franklin Benjamin Jefferson Elexander Phelps foundit there and opened the door of it to see if the rats would come outand they did and Aunt Sally she come in and when we got back she wasastanding on top of the bed raising Cain and the rats was doing whatthey could to keep off the dull times for her  So she took and dustedus both with the hickry and we was as much as two hours catchinganother fifteen or sixteen drat that meddlesome cub and they warntthe likeliest nuther because the first haul was the pick of the flock I never see a likelier lot of rats than what that first haul wasWe got a splendid stock of sorted spiders and bugs and frogs andcaterpillars and one thing or another and we like to got a hornetsnest but we didnt  The family was at home  We didnt give it rightup but stayed with them as long as we could because we allowed wedtire them out or theyd got to tire us out and they done it  Then wegot allycumpain and rubbed on the places and was pretty near all rightagain but couldnt set down convenient  And so we went for the snakesand grabbed a couple of dozen garters and housesnakes and put them ina bag and put it in our room and by that time it was suppertime anda rattling good honest days work  and hungryoh no I reckon not And there warnt a blessed snake up there when we went backwe didnthalf tie the sack and they worked out somehow and left  But it didntmatter much because they was still on the premises somewheres  Sowe judged we could get some of them again  No there warnt no realscarcity of snakes about the house for a considerable spell  Youd seethem dripping from the rafters and places every now and then and theygenerly landed in your plate or down the back of your neck and mostof the time where you didnt want them  Well they was handsome andstriped and there warnt no harm in a million of them but that nevermade no difference to Aunt Sally she despised snakes be the breed whatthey might and she couldnt stand them no way you could fix it andevery time one of them flopped down on her it didnt make no differencewhat she was doing she would just lay that work down and light out  Inever see such a woman  And you could hear her whoop to Jericho  Youcouldnt get her to take aholt of one of them with the tongs  And ifshe turned over and found one in bed she would scramble out and lift ahowl that you would think the house was afire  She disturbed the oldman so that he said he could most wish there hadnt ever been no snakescreated  Why after every last snake had been gone clear out of thehouse for as much as a week Aunt Sally warnt over it yet she warntnear over it when she was setting thinking about something you couldtouch her on the back of her neck with a feather and she would jumpright out of her stockings  It was very curious  But Tom said allwomen was just so  He said they was made that way for some reason orotherWe got a licking every time one of our snakes come in her way and sheallowed these lickings warnt nothing to what she would do if we everloaded up the place again with them  I didnt mind the lickingsbecause they didnt amount to nothing but I minded the trouble wehad to lay in another lot  But we got them laid in and all the otherthings and you never see a cabin as blithesome as Jims was when theydall swarm out for music and go for him  Jim didnt like the spidersand the spiders didnt like Jim and so theyd lay for him and make itmighty warm for him  And he said that between the rats and the snakesand the grindstone there warnt no room in bed for him skasely andwhen there was a body couldnt sleep it was so lively and it wasalways lively he said because they never all slept at one time buttook turn about so when the snakes was asleep the rats was on deck andwhen the rats turned in the snakes come on watch so he always had onegang under him in his way and tother gang having a circus over himand if he got up to hunt a new place the spiders would take a chance athim as he crossed over He said if he ever got out this time he wouldntever be a prisoner again not for a salaryWell by the end of three weeks everything was in pretty good shape The shirt was sent in early in a pie and every time a rat bit Jim hewould get up and write a little in his journal whilst the ink was freshthe pens was made the inscriptions and so on was all carved on thegrindstone the bedleg was sawed in two and we had et up the sawdustand it give us a most amazing stomachache  We reckoned we was allgoing to die but didnt  It was the most undigestible sawdust I eversee and Tom said the sameBut as I was saying wed got all the work done now at last and we wasall pretty much fagged out too but mainly Jim  The old man had wrotea couple of times to the plantation below Orleans to come and get theirrunaway nigger but hadnt got no answer because there warnt no suchplantation so he allowed he would advertise Jim in the St Louis andNew Orleans papers and when he mentioned the St Louis ones it give methe cold shivers and I see we hadnt no time to lose So Tom said nowfor the nonnamous lettersWhats them  I saysWarnings to the people that something is up  Sometimes its done oneway sometimes another  But theres always somebody spying around thatgives notice to the governor of the castle  When Louis XVI was goingto light out of the Tooleries a servantgirl done it  Its a very goodway and so is the nonnamous letters  Well use them both  And itsusual for the prisoners mother to change clothes with him and shestays in and he slides out in her clothes  Well do that tooBut looky here Tom what do we want to warn anybody for thatsomethings up  Let them find it out for themselvesits theirlookoutYes I know but you cant depend on them  Its the way theyve actedfrom the very startleft us to do everything  Theyre so confidingand mulletheaded they dont take notice of nothing at all  So if wedont give them notice there wont be nobody nor nothing to interferewith us and so after all our hard work and trouble this escape ll gooff perfectly flat wont amount to nothingwont be nothing to itWell as for me Tom thats the way Id likeShucks he says and looked disgusted  So I saysBut I aint going to make no complaint  Any way that suits you suitsme What you going to do about the servantgirlYoull be her  You slide in in the middle of the night and hook thatyaller girls frockWhy Tom that ll make trouble next morning because of course sheprobbly haint got any but that oneI know but you dont want it but fifteen minutes to carry thenonnamous letter and shove it under the front doorAll right then Ill do it but I could carry it just as handy in myown togsYou wouldnt look like a servantgirl then would youNo but there wont be nobody to see what I look like anywayThat aint got nothing to do with it  The thing for us to do is justto do our duty and not worry about whether anybody sees us do it ornot Haint you got no principle at allAll right I aint saying nothing Im the servantgirl  Whos JimsmotherIm his mother  Ill hook a gown from Aunt SallyWell then youll have to stay in the cabin when me and Jim leavesNot much  Ill stuff Jims clothes full of straw and lay it on his bedto represent his mother in disguise and Jim ll take the nigger womansgown off of me and wear it and well all evade together  When aprisoner of style escapes its called an evasion  Its always calledso when a king escapes frinstance  And the same with a kings sonit dont make no difference whether hes a natural one or an unnaturaloneSo Tom he wrote the nonnamous letter and I smouched the yaller wenchsfrock that night and put it on and shoved it under the front door theway Tom told me to  It saidBeware  Trouble is brewing  Keep a sharp lookout Unknown FriendNext night we stuck a picture which Tom drawed in blood of a skull andcrossbones on the front door and next night another one of a coffin onthe back door  I never see a family in such a sweat  They couldnt abeen worse scared if the place had a been full of ghosts laying for thembehind everything and under the beds and shivering through the air  Ifa door banged Aunt Sally she jumped and said ouch if anything fellshe jumped and said ouch if you happened to touch her when shewarnt noticing she done the same she couldnt face noway and besatisfied because she allowed there was something behind her everytimeso she was always awhirling around sudden and saying ouch andbefore shed got twothirds around shed whirl back again and say itagain and she was afraid to go to bed but she dasnt set up  So thething was working very well Tom said he said he never see a thing workmore satisfactory He said it showed it was done rightSo he said now for the grand bulge  So the very next morning at thestreak of dawn we got another letter ready and was wondering what webetter do with it because we heard them say at supper they was goingto have a nigger on watch at both doors all night  Tom he went down thelightningrod to spy around and the nigger at the back door was asleepand he stuck it in the back of his neck and come back  This lettersaidDont betray me I wish to be your friend  There is a desprate gang ofcutthroats from over in the Indian Territory going to steal your runawaynigger tonight and they have been trying to scare you so as you willstay in the house and not bother them  I am one of the gang but havegot religgion and wish to quit it and lead an honest life again andwill betray the helish design They will sneak down from northardsalong the fence at midnight exact with a false key and go in theniggers cabin to get him I am to be off a piece and blow a tin hornif I see any danger but stead of that I will baa like a sheep soon asthey get in and not blow at all then whilst they are getting hischains loose you slip there and lock them in and can kill them at yourleasure  Dont do anything but just the way I am telling you if you dothey will suspicion something and raise whoopjamboreehoo I do not wishany reward but to know I have done the right thing Unknown FriendCHAPTER XLWE was feeling pretty good after breakfast and took my canoe and wentover the river afishing with a lunch and had a good time and took alook at the raft and found her all right and got home late to supperand found them in such a sweat and worry they didnt know which end theywas standing on and made us go right off to bed the minute we was donesupper and wouldnt tell us what the trouble was and never let on aword about the new letter but didnt need to because we knowed as muchabout it as anybody did and as soon as we was half up stairs and herback was turned we slid for the cellar cupboard and loaded up a goodlunch and took it up to our room and went to bed and got up abouthalfpast eleven and Tom put on Aunt Sallys dress that he stole andwas going to start with the lunch but saysWheres the butterI laid out a hunk of it I says on a piece of a cornponeWell you left it laid out thenit aint hereWe can get along without it I saysWe can get along with it too he says just you slide down cellarand fetch it  And then mosey right down the lightningrod and comealong Ill go and stuff the straw into Jims clothes to represent hismother in disguise and be ready to baa like a sheep and shove soon asyou get thereSo out he went and down cellar went I The hunk of butter big asa persons fist was where I had left it so I took up the slab ofcornpone with it on and blowed out my light and started up stairsvery stealthy and got up to the main floor all right but here comesAunt Sally with a candle and I clapped the truck in my hat and clappedmy hat on my head and the next second she see me and she saysYou been down cellarYesmWhat you been doing down thereNothnNothnNomWell then what possessed you to go down there this time of nightI dont know mYou dont know  Dont answer me that way Tom I want to know whatyou been doing down thereI haint been doing a single thing Aunt Sally I hope to gracious if IhaveI reckoned shed let me go now and as a generl thing she would but Ispose there was so many strange things going on she was just in a sweatabout every little thing that warnt yardstick straight so she saysvery decidedYou just march into that settingroom and stay there till I come  Youbeen up to something you no business to and I lay Ill find out what itis before IM done with youSo she went away as I opened the door and walked into the settingroomMy but there was a crowd there  Fifteen farmers and every one of themhad a gun  I was most powerful sick and slunk to a chair and set downThey was setting around some of them talking a little in a low voiceand all of them fidgety and uneasy but trying to look like they warntbut I knowed they was because they was always taking off their hatsand putting them on and scratching their heads and changing theirseats and fumbling with their buttons  I warnt easy myself but Ididnt take my hat off all the sameI did wish Aunt Sally would come and get done with me and lick me ifshe wanted to and let me get away and tell Tom how wed overdone thisthing and what a thundering hornetsnest wed got ourselves into sowe could stop fooling around straight off and clear out with Jim beforethese rips got out of patience and come for usAt last she come and begun to ask me questions but I couldnt answerthem straight I didnt know which end of me was up because these menwas in such a fidget now that some was wanting to start right NOW andlay for them desperadoes and saying it warnt but a few minutes tomidnight and others was trying to get them to hold on and wait for thesheepsignal and here was Aunty pegging away at the questions andme ashaking all over and ready to sink down in my tracks I wasthat scared and the place getting hotter and hotter and the butterbeginning to melt and run down my neck and behind my ears and prettysoon when one of them says IM for going and getting in the cabinfirst and right now and catching them when they come I mostdropped and a streak of butter come atrickling down my forehead andAunt Sally she see it and turns white as a sheet and saysFor the lands sake what is the matter with the child  Hes got thebrainfever as shore as youre born and theyre oozing outAnd everybody runs to see and she snatches off my hat and out comesthe bread and what was left of the butter and she grabbed me andhugged me and saysOh what a turn you did give me and how glad and grateful I am itaint no worse for lucks against us and it never rains but it poursand when I see that truck I thought wed lost you for I knowed bythe color and all it was just like your brains would be ifDeardear whydnt you tell me that was what youd been down there for Iwouldnt a cared  Now cler out to bed and dont lemme see no more ofyou till morningI was up stairs in a second and down the lightningrod in another oneand shinning through the dark for the leanto  I couldnt hardly get mywords out I was so anxious but I told Tom as quick as I could we mustjump for it now and not a minute to losethe house full of men yonderwith gunsHis eyes just blazed and he saysNois that so  aint it bully  Why Huck if it was to do overagain I bet I could fetch two hundred  If we could put it off tillHurry  Hurry  I says  Wheres JimRight at your elbow if you reach out your arm you can touch him Hes dressed and everythings ready  Now well slide out and give thesheepsignalBut then we heard the tramp of men coming to the door and heard thembegin to fumble with the padlock and heard a man sayI told you wed be too soon they havent comethe door is lockedHere Ill lock some of you into the cabin and you lay for em in thedark and kill em when they come and the rest scatter around a pieceand listen if you can hear em comingSo in they come but couldnt see us in the dark and most trod onus whilst we was hustling to get under the bed  But we got under allright and out through the hole swift but softJim first me nextand Tom last which was according to Toms orders  Now we was in theleanto and heard trampings close by outside  So we crept to the doorand Tom stopped us there and put his eye to the crack but couldnt makeout nothing it was so dark and whispered and said he would listenfor the steps to get further and when he nudged us Jim must glide outfirst and him last  So he set his ear to the crack and listened andlistened and listened and the steps ascraping around out there allthe time and at last he nudged us and we slid out and stooped downnot breathing and not making the least noise and slipped stealthytowards the fence in Injun file and got to it all right and me and Jimover it but Toms britches catched fast on a splinter on the toprail and then he hear the steps coming so he had to pull loose whichsnapped the splinter and made a noise and as he dropped in our tracksand started somebody sings outWhos that  Answer or Ill shootBut we didnt answer we just unfurled our heels and shoved  Then therewas a rush and a Bang Bang Bang and the bullets fairly whizzedaround us We heard them sing outHere they are  Theyve broke for the river  After em boys and turnloose the dogsSo here they come full tilt  We could hear them because they woreboots and yelled but we didnt wear no boots and didnt yell  We wasin the path to the mill and when they got pretty close on to us wedodged into the bush and let them go by and then dropped in behindthem  Theyd had all the dogs shut up so they wouldnt scare off therobbers but by this time somebody had let them loose and here theycome making powwow enough for a million but they was our dogs so westopped in our tracks till they catched up and when they see it warntnobody but us and no excitement to offer them they only just saidhowdy and tore right ahead towards the shouting and clattering andthen we upsteam again and whizzed along after them till we was nearlyto the mill and then struck up through the bush to where my canoe wastied and hopped in and pulled for dear life towards the middle of theriver but didnt make no more noise than we was obleeged to Then westruck out easy and comfortable for the island where my raft was andwe could hear them yelling and barking at each other all up and down thebank till we was so far away the sounds got dim and died out  And whenwe stepped on to the raft I saysNow old Jim youre a free man again and I bet you wont ever be aslave no moreEn a mighty good job it wuz too Huck  It uz planned beautiful enit uz done beautiful en dey aint nobody kin git up a plan dats momixedup en splendid den what dat one wuzWe was all glad as we could be but Tom was the gladdest of all becausehe had a bullet in the calf of his legWhen me and Jim heard that we didnt feel so brash as what we didbefore It was hurting him considerable and bleeding so we laid him inthe wigwam and tore up one of the dukes shirts for to bandage him buthe saysGimme the rags I can do it myself  Dont stop now dont fool aroundhere and the evasion booming along so handsome man the sweeps and sether loose  Boys we done it elegantdeed we did  I wish wed ahad the handling of Louis XVI there wouldnt a been no Son of SaintLouis ascend to heaven wrote down in his biography no sir weda whooped him over the borderthats what wed a done with himanddone it just as slick as nothing at all too  Man the sweepsman thesweepsBut me and Jim was consultingand thinking  And after wed thought aminute I saysSay it JimSo he saysWell den dis is de way it look to me Huck  Ef it wuz him dat uzbein sot free en one er de boys wuz to git shot would he say Go onen save me nemmine bout a doctor fr to save dis one  Is dat likeMars Tom Sawyer  Would he say dat  You bet he wouldnt  wellden is Jim gywne to say it  No sahI doan budge a step outn displace dout a doctor not if its forty yearI knowed he was white inside and I reckoned hed say what he did saysoit was all right now and I told Tom I was agoing for a doctor He raised considerable row about it but me and Jim stuck to it andwouldnt budge so he was for crawling out and setting the raft loosehimself but we wouldnt let him  Then he give us a piece of his mindbut it didnt do no goodSo when he sees me getting the canoe ready he saysWell then if youre bound to go Ill tell you the way to do when youget to the village  Shut the door and blindfold the doctor tight andfast and make him swear to be silent as the grave and put a pursefull of gold in his hand and then take and lead him all around theback alleys and everywheres in the dark and then fetch him here in thecanoe in a roundabout way amongst the islands and search him and takehis chalk away from him and dont give it back to him till you get himback to the village or else he will chalk this raft so he can find itagain Its the way they all doSo I said I would and left and Jim was to hide in the woods when hesee the doctor coming till he was gone againCHAPTER XLITHE doctor was an old man a very nice kindlooking old man when I gothim up  I told him me and my brother was over on Spanish Island huntingyesterday afternoon and camped on a piece of a raft we found and aboutmidnight he must a kicked his gun in his dreams for it went off andshot him in the leg and we wanted him to go over there and fix it andnot say nothing about it nor let anybody know because we wanted tocome home this evening and surprise the folksWho is your folks he saysThe Phelpses down yonderOh he says  And after a minute he saysHowd you say he got shotHe had a dream I says and it shot himSingular dream he saysSo he lit up his lantern and got his saddlebags and we started  Butwhen he sees the canoe he didnt like the look of hersaid she was bigenough for one but didnt look pretty safe for two  I saysOh you neednt be afeard sir she carried the three of us easyenoughWhat threeWhy me and Sid andandand the guns thats what I meanOh he saysBut he put his foot on the gunnel and rocked her and shook his headand said he reckoned hed look around for a bigger one  But they wasall locked and chained so he took my canoe and said for me to waittill he come back or I could hunt around further or maybe I bettergo down home and get them ready for the surprise if I wanted to  ButI said I didnt so I told him just how to find the raft and then hestartedI struck an idea pretty soon  I says to myself sposn he cant fixthat leg just in three shakes of a sheeps tail as the saying issposn it takes him three or four days  What are we going to dolayaround there till he lets the cat out of the bag  No sir I know whatIll do  Ill wait and when he comes back if he says hes got togo any more Ill get down there too if I swim and well take and tiehim and keep him and shove out down the river and when Toms donewith him well give him what its worth or all we got and then let himget ashoreSo then I crept into a

fluster I wasin by the time midnight come last night  I hope to gracious if I warntafraid theyd steal some o the family  I was just to that pass Ididnt have no reasoning faculties no more  It looks foolish enoughnow in the daytime but I says to myself theres my two poor boysasleep way up stairs in that lonesome room and I declare to goodnessI was that uneasy t I crep up there and locked em in  I did  Andanybody would Because you know when you get scared that way and itkeeps running on and getting worse and worse all the time and yourwits gets to addling and you get to doing all sorts o wild thingsand by and by you think to yourself sposn I was a boy and was away upthere and the door aint locked and you She stopped looking kindof wondering and then she turned her head around slow and when her eyelit on meI got up and took a walkSays I to myself I can explain better how we come to not be in thatroom this morning if I go out to one side and study over it a little So I done it  But I dasnt go fur or shed a sent for me  And whenit was late in the day the people all went and then I come in andtold her the noise and shooting waked up me and Sid and the door waslocked and we wanted to see the fun so we went down the lightningrodand both of us got hurt a little and we didnt never want to try thatno more  And then I went on and told her all what I told Uncle Silasbefore and then she said shed forgive us and maybe it was all rightenough anyway and about what a body might expect of boys for all boyswas a pretty harumscarum lot as fur as she could see and so as longas no harm hadnt come of it she judged she better put in her timebeing grateful we was alive and well and she had us still stead offretting over what was past and done  So then she kissed me and pattedme on the head and dropped into a kind of a brown study and prettysoon jumps up and saysWhy lawsamercy its most night and Sid not come yet  What hasbecome of that boyI see my chance so I skips up and saysIll run right up to town and get him I saysNo you wont she says  Youll stay right wher you are onesenough to be lost at a time  If he aint here to supper your uncle llgoWell he warnt there to supper so right after supper uncle wentHe come back about ten a little bit uneasy hadnt run across Tomstrack Aunt Sally was a good deal uneasy but Uncle Silas he saidthere warnt no occasion to beboys will be boys he said and youllsee this one turn up in the morning all sound and right  So she hadto be satisfied  But she said shed set up for him a while anyway andkeep a light burning so he could see itAnd then when I went up to bed she come up with me and fetched hercandle and tucked me in and mothered me so good I felt mean and likeI couldnt look her in the face and she set down on the bed and talkedwith me a long time and said what a splendid boy Sid was and didntseem to want to ever stop talking about him and kept asking me everynow and then if I reckoned he could a got lost or hurt or maybedrownded and might be laying at this minute somewheres suffering ordead and she not by him to help him and so the tears would drip downsilent and I would tell her that Sid was all right and would be homein the morning sure and she would squeeze my hand or maybe kiss meand tell me to say it again and keep on saying it because it done hergood and she was in so much trouble  And when she was going away shelooked down in my eyes so steady and gentle and saysThe door aint going to be locked Tom and theres the window andthe rod but youll be good wont you  And you wont go  For mysakeLaws knows I wanted to go bad enough to see about Tom and was allintending to go but after that I wouldnt a went not for kingdomsBut she was on my mind and Tom was on my mind so I slept very restlessAnd twice I went down the rod away in the night and slipped aroundfront and see her setting there by her candle in the window with hereyes towards the road and the tears in them and I wished I could dosomething for her but I couldnt only to swear that I wouldnt neverdo nothing to grieve her any more  And the third time I waked up atdawn and slid down and she was there yet and her candle was most outand her old gray head was resting on her hand and she was asleepCHAPTER XLIITHE old man was uptown again before breakfast but couldnt get notrack of Tom and both of them set at the table thinking and not sayingnothing and looking mournful and their coffee getting cold and noteating anything And by and by the old man saysDid I give you the letterWhat letterThe one I got yesterday out of the postofficeNo you didnt give me no letterWell I must a forgot itSo he rummaged his pockets and then went off somewheres where he hadlaid it down and fetched it and give it to her  She saysWhy its from St Petersburgits from SisI allowed another walk would do me good but I couldnt stir  Butbefore she could break it open she dropped it and runfor she seesomething And so did I It was Tom Sawyer on a mattress and that olddoctor and Jim in her calico dress with his hands tied behind himand a lot of people  I hid the letter behind the first thing that comehandy and rushed  She flung herself at Tom crying and saysOh hes dead hes dead I know hes deadAnd Tom he turned his head a little and muttered something or otherwhich showed he warnt in his right mind then she flung up her handsand saysHes alive thank God  And thats enough and she snatched a kiss ofhim and flew for the house to get the bed ready and scattering ordersright and left at the niggers and everybody else as fast as her tonguecould go every jump of the wayI followed the men to see what they was going to do with Jim and theold doctor and Uncle Silas followed after Tom into the house  The menwas very huffy and some of them wanted to hang Jim for an example toall the other niggers around there so they wouldnt be trying to runaway like Jim done and making such a raft of trouble and keeping awhole family scared most to death for days and nights  But the otherssaid dont do it it wouldnt answer at all he aint our nigger andhis owner would turn up and make us pay for him sure  So that cooledthem down a little because the people thats always the most anxiousfor to hang a nigger that haint done just right is always the veryones that aint the most anxious to pay for him when theyve got theirsatisfaction out of himThey cussed Jim considerble though and give him a cuff or two side thehead once in a while but Jim never said nothing and he never let on toknow me and they took him to the same cabin and put his own clotheson him and chained him again and not to no bedleg this time but toa big staple drove into the bottom log and chained his hands too andboth legs and said he warnt to have nothing but bread and water toeat after this till his owner come or he was sold at auction becausehe didnt come in a certain length of time and filled up our hole andsaid a couple of farmers with guns must stand watch around about thecabin every night and a bulldog tied to the door in the daytime andabout this time they was through with the job and was tapering off witha kind of generl goodbye cussing and then the old doctor comes andtakes a look and saysDont be no rougher on him than youre obleeged to because he ainta bad nigger  When I got to where I found the boy I see I couldnt cutthe bullet out without some help and he warnt in no condition forme to leave to go and get help and he got a little worse and a littleworse and after a long time he went out of his head and wouldnt letme come anigh him any more and said if I chalked his raft hed killme and no end of wild foolishness like that and I see I couldnt doanything at all with him so I says I got to have help somehow andthe minute I says it out crawls this nigger from somewheres and sayshell help and he done it too and done it very well  Of course Ijudged he must be a runaway nigger and there I was and there I hadto stick right straight along all the rest of the day and all night  Itwas a fix I tell you I had a couple of patients with the chills andof course Id of liked to run up to town and see them but I dasntbecause the nigger might get away and then Id be to blame and yetnever a skiff come close enough for me to hail  So there I had to stickplumb until daylight this morning and I never see a nigger that was abetter nuss or faithfuller and yet he was risking his freedom to do itand was all tired out too and I see plain enough hed been workedmain hard lately  I liked the nigger for that I tell you gentlemen anigger like that is worth a thousand dollarsand kind treatment too  Ihad everything I needed and the boy was doing as well there as hewould a done at homebetter maybe because it was so quiet but there Iwas with both of m on my hands and there I had to stick till aboutdawn this morning then some men in a skiff come by and as good luckwould have it the nigger was setting by the pallet with his head proppedon his knees sound asleep so I motioned them in quiet and they slippedup on him and grabbed him and tied him before he knowed what he wasabout and we never had no trouble And the boy being in a kind of aflighty sleep too we muffled the oars and hitched the raft on andtowed her over very nice and quiet and the nigger never made the leastrow nor said a word from the start  He aint no bad nigger gentlementhats what I think about himSomebody saysWell it sounds very good doctor Im obleeged to sayThen the others softened up a little too and I was mighty thankfulto that old doctor for doing Jim that good turn and I was glad it wasaccording to my judgment of him too because I thought he had a goodheart in him and was a good man the first time I see him  Then theyall agreed that Jim had acted very well and was deserving to have somenotice took of it and reward  So every one of them promised right outand hearty that they wouldnt cuss him no moreThen they come out and locked him up  I hoped they was going to say hecould have one or two of the chains took off because they was rottenheavy or could have meat and greens with his bread and water but theydidnt think of it and I reckoned it warnt best for me to mix in butI judged Id get the doctors yarn to Aunt Sally somehow or other assoon as Id got through the breakers that was laying just ahead ofmeexplanations I mean of how I forgot to mention about Sid being shotwhen I was telling how him and me put in that dratted night paddlingaround hunting the runaway niggerBut I had plenty time  Aunt Sally she stuck to the sickroom all dayand all night and every time I see Uncle Silas mooning around I dodgedhimNext morning I heard Tom was a good deal better and they said AuntSally was gone to get a nap  So I slips to the sickroom and if Ifound him awake I reckoned we could put up a yarn for the family thatwould wash But he was sleeping and sleeping very peaceful too andpale not firefaced the way he was when he come  So I set down andlaid for him to wake  In about half an hour Aunt Sally comes glidingin and there I was up a stump again  She motioned me to be still andset down by me and begun to whisper and said we could all be joyfulnow because all the symptoms was firstrate and hed been sleepinglike that for ever so long and looking better and peacefuller all thetime and ten to one hed wake up in his right mindSo we set there watching and by and by he stirs a bit and opened hiseyes very natural and takes a look and saysHellowhy Im at home  Hows that  Wheres the raftIts all right I saysAnd JimThe same I says but couldnt say it pretty brash  But he nevernoticed but saysGood  Splendid  Now were all right and safe Did you tell AuntyI was going to say yes but she chipped in and says  About what SidWhy about the way the whole thing was doneWhat whole thingWhy the whole thing  There aint but one how we set the runawaynigger freeme and TomGood land  Set the runWhat is the child talking about  Dear dearout of his head againNo I aint out of my head I know all what Im talking about  Wedid set him freeme and Tom  We laid out to do it and we done it And we done it elegant too  Hed got a start and she never checkedhim up just set and stared and stared and let him clip along andI see it warnt no use for me to put in  Why Aunty it cost us apower of workweeks of ithours and hours every night whilst you wasall asleep And we had to steal candles and the sheet and the shirtand your dress and spoons and tin plates and caseknives and thewarmingpan and the grindstone and flour and just no end of thingsand you cant think what work it was to make the saws and pens andinscriptions and one thing or another and you cant think half thefun it was  And we had to make up the pictures of coffins and thingsand nonnamous letters from the robbers and get up and down thelightningrod and dig the hole into the cabin and made the rope ladderand send it in cooked up in a pie and send in spoons and things to workwith in your apron pocketMercy sakesand load up the cabin with rats and snakes and so on for company forJim and then you kept Tom here so long with the butter in his hat thatyou come near spiling the whole business because the men come beforewe was out of the cabin and we had to rush and they heard us and letdrive at us and I got my share and we dodged out of the path and letthem go by and when the dogs come they warnt interested in us butwent for the most noise and we got our canoe and made for theraft and was all safe and Jim was a free man and we done it all byourselves and wasnt it bully AuntyWell I never heard the likes of it in all my born days  So it wasyou you little rapscallions thats been making all this troubleand turned everybodys wits clean inside out and scared us all most todeath  Ive as good a notion as ever I had in my life to take it outo you this very minute  To think here Ive been night after nightayou just get well once you young scamp and I lay Ill tan the OldHarry out o both o yeBut Tom he was so proud and joyful he just couldnt hold inand his tongue just went itshe achipping in and spitting fire allalong and both of them going it at once like a cat convention and shesaysWell you get all the enjoyment you can out of it now for mind Itell you if I catch you meddling with him againMeddling with who  Tom says dropping his smile and lookingsurprisedWith who  Why the runaway nigger of course  Whod you reckonTom looks at me very grave and saysTom didnt you just tell me he was all right  Hasnt he got awayHim says Aunt Sally the runaway nigger  Deed he hasnt Theyve got him back safe and sound and hes in that cabin againon bread and water and loaded down with chains till hes claimed orsoldTom rose square up in bed with his eye hot and his nostrils openingand shutting like gills and sings out to meThey haint no right to shut him up  SHOVEand dont you lose aminute  Turn him loose he aint no slave hes as free as any creturthat walks this earthWhat does the child meanI mean every word I say Aunt Sally and if somebody dont go Illgo Ive knowed him all his life and so has Tom there  Old MissWatson died two months ago and she was ashamed she ever was going tosell him down the river and said so and she set him free in herwillThen what on earth did you want to set him free for seeing he wasalready freeWell that is a question I must say and just like women  WhyI wanted the adventure of it and Id a waded neckdeep in bloodtogoodness alive Aunt PollyIf she warnt standing right there just inside the door looking assweet and contented as an angel half full of pie I wish I may neverAunt Sally jumped for her and most hugged the head off of her andcried over her and I found a good enough place for me under the bedfor it was getting pretty sultry for us seemed to me  And I peepedout and in a little while Toms Aunt Polly shook herself loose andstood there looking across at Tom over her spectacleskind of grindinghim into the earth you know  And then she saysYes you better turn yr head awayI would if I was you TomOh deary me says Aunt Sally Is he changed so  Why that aintTom its Sid TomsTomswhy where is Tom  He was here a minuteagoYou mean wheres Huck Finnthats what you mean  I reckon I haintraised such a scamp as my Tom all these years not to know him when Isee him  That would be a pretty howdydo Come out from under thatbed Huck FinnSo I done it  But not feeling brashAunt Sally she was one of the mixedupestlooking persons I everseeexcept one and that was Uncle Silas when he come in and they toldit all to him  It kind of made him drunk as you may say and he didntknow nothing at all the rest of the day and preached a prayermeetingsermon that night that gave him a rattling ruputation because theoldest man in the world couldnt a understood it  So Toms Aunt Pollyshe told all about who I was and what and I had to up and tell howI was in such a tight place that when Mrs Phelps took me for TomSawyershe chipped in and says Oh go on and call me Aunt Sally Imused to it now and taint no need to changethat when Aunt Sally tookme for Tom Sawyer I had to stand itthere warnt no other way andI knowed he wouldnt mind because it would be nuts for him beinga mystery and hed make an adventure out of it and be perfectlysatisfied  And so it turned out and he let on to be Sid and madethings as soft as he could for meAnd his Aunt Polly she said Tom was right about old Miss Watson settingJim free in her will and so sure enough Tom Sawyer had gone and tookall that trouble and bother to set a free nigger free and I couldntever understand before until that minute and that talk how he couldhelp a body set a nigger free with his bringingupWell Aunt Polly she said that when Aunt Sally wrote to her that Tom andSid had come all right and safe she says to herselfLook at that now  I might have expected it letting him go off thatway without anybody to watch him  So now I got to go and trapse allthe way down the river eleven hundred mile and find out what thatcreeturs up to this time as long as I couldnt seem to get anyanswer out of you about itWhy I never heard nothing from you says Aunt SallyWell I wonder  Why I wrote you twice to ask you what you could meanby Sid being hereWell I never got em SisAunt Polly she turns around slow and severe and saysYou TomWellwhat he says kind of pettishDont you what me you impudent thinghand out them lettersWhat lettersThem letters  I be bound if I have to take aholt of you IllTheyre in the trunk  There now  And theyre just the same as theywas when I got them out of the office  I haint looked into them Ihaint touched them  But I knowed theyd make trouble and I thought ifyou warnt in no hurry IdWell you do need skinning there aint no mistake about it  And Iwrote another one to tell you I was coming and I spose heNo it come yesterday I haint read it yet but its all right Ivegot that oneI wanted to offer to bet two dollars she hadnt but I reckoned maybe itwas just as safe to not to  So I never said nothingCHAPTER THE LASTTHE first time I catched Tom private I asked him what was his idea timeof the evasionwhat it was hed planned to do if the evasion worked allright and he managed to set a nigger free that was already free beforeAnd he said what he had planned in his head from the start if we gotJim out all safe was for us to run him down the river on the raft andhave adventures plumb to the mouth of the river and then tell him abouthis being free and take him back up home on a steamboat in styleand pay him for his lost time and write word ahead and get out allthe niggers around and have them waltz him into town with a torchlightprocession and a brassband and then he would be a hero and so wouldwe  But I reckoned it was about as well the way it wasWe had Jim out of the chains in no time and when Aunt Polly and UncleSilas and Aunt Sally found out how good he helped the doctor nurse Tomthey made a heap of fuss over him and fixed him up prime and give himall he wanted to eat and a good time and nothing to do  And we hadhim up to the sickroom and had a high talk and Tom give Jim fortydollars for being prisoner for us so patient and doing it up so goodand Jim was pleased most to death and busted out and saysDah now Huck what I tell youwhat I tell you up dah on Jacksonislan  I tole you I got a hairy breas en whats de sign un it enI tole you I ben rich wunst en gwineter to be rich agin en itscome true en heah she is  dah now doan talk to mesigns issigns mine I tell you en I knowed jis s well at I uz gwineter berich agin as Is astannin heah dis minuteAnd then Tom he talked along and talked along and says les all threeslide out of here one of these nights and get an outfit and go forhowling adventures amongst the Injuns over in the Territory for acouple of weeks or two and I says all right that suits me but Iaint got no money for to buy the outfit and I reckon I couldnt getnone from home because its likely paps been back before now and gotit all away from Judge Thatcher and drunk it upNo he haint Tom says its all there yetsix thousand dollarsand more and your pap haint ever been back since  Hadnt when I comeaway anyhowJim says kind of solemnHe aint acomin back no mo HuckI saysWhy JimNemmine why Huckbut he aint comin back no moBut I kept at him so at last he saysDoan you member de house dat was floatn down de river en dey wuz aman in dah kivered up en I went in en unkivered him and didn let youcome in  Well den you kin git yo money when you wants it kase datwuz himToms most well now and got his bullet around his neck on a watchguardfor a watch and is always seeing what time it is and so there aintnothing more to write about and I am rotten glad of it because if Ida knowed what a trouble it was to make a book I wouldnt a tackled itand aint agoing to no more  But I reckon I got to light out for theTerritory ahead of the rest because Aunt Sally shes going to adopt meand sivilize me and I cant stand it  I been there beforeTHE END YOURS TRULY HUCK
